There's something profound about reading letters from people who had no idea they would be remembered by history. Their honesty, their small concerns, their humanity—it makes the past feel immediate and real.

When I read Van Gogh writing to Theo about his struggles with money and mental health, or Jane Austen gossiping about her neighbors to Cassandra, these historical figures become people rather than monuments. They worried about rent, got excited about small social events, felt lonely and misunderstood.

This accidental intimacy might be lost to future historians studying our era. Our digital communications are so ephemeral, so guarded by privacy concerns. Will scholars in 2200 understand how we lived and felt, or will our era remain opaque in ways the letter-writing centuries are not?
