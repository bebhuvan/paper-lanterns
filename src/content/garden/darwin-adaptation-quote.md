Found this beautiful passage in Darwin's letters today: "It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change." Though often misattributed to him, the sentiment captures something essential about adaptation and resilience.

The quote itself reveals something interesting about how ideas evolve and adapt - much like species themselves. This particular phrasing became more "fit" for sharing than Darwin's actual words, spreading widely because it captured a truth people wanted to express, even if Darwin never quite said it this way.
