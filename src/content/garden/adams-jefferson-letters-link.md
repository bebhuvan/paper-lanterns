The entire correspondence between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, spanning their friendship, political rivalry, and reconciliation, is available online. These letters reveal how two brilliant minds could disagree profoundly yet maintain deep respect.

What strikes me most is how their letters show the evolution of American political thought in real time. They disagreed on nearly everything - federalism, foreign policy, the role of government - yet never lost their fundamental respect for each other's intellect and character.

Their reconciliation in old age, orchestrated partly through Benjamin Rush's mediation, gives me hope for our own polarized times. If Adams and Jefferson could bridge their differences, perhaps there's always hope for civil discourse.
