The world is crying for peace. The West is desiring the restoration of peace through a League of Powers. But peace is not merely the absence of war; it is not merely a political arrangement. True peace is a state of mind, a condition of the heart, a way of life.

The Great War has ended, but has it really ended? The guns are silent, but the hatred remains. The armies have disbanded, but the spirit of militarism lives on. The treaties are signed, but the causes of war are still present. We have achieved an armistice, not peace.

What is this League of Nations that promises to bring peace to the world? Is it merely a new arrangement of the old system, a more sophisticated form of the balance of power? Or is it a genuine attempt to create a new order based on justice and cooperation rather than force and competition?

The danger is that we may mistake the shadow for the substance, the form for the spirit. We may create elaborate machinery for peace while our hearts remain unchanged. We may build institutions of cooperation while our minds are still dominated by the spirit of competition and conflict.

True peace cannot be imposed from above; it must grow from within. It cannot be achieved by governments alone; it requires the cooperation of peoples. It cannot be maintained by force; it must be sustained by understanding and goodwill.

The root of war lies not in political disagreements or economic competition, but in the human heart. As long as men think in terms of 'us' and 'them', as long as they see other nations as rivals rather than partners, as long as they value power more than justice, there will be no lasting peace.

Education has a crucial role to play in creating this new consciousness. We must educate our children not to be patriots in the narrow sense, but to be citizens of the world. We must teach them to see humanity as one family, to regard the welfare of all as their own welfare.

But education alone is not enough. We need a new religion—not in the sectarian sense, but in the sense of a new reverence for life, a new respect for human dignity, a new commitment to the welfare of all. We need to cultivate the spirit of love and service, not just toward our own people but toward all humanity.

The East has much to contribute to this new consciousness. Our ancient wisdom teaches that all life is one, that the individual and the universal are interconnected, that the welfare of one depends on the welfare of all. This is not mere philosophy; it is practical wisdom for the modern world.

But the East must not simply retreat into ancient wisdom; it must engage with modern realities. We must show that our spiritual insights are not escapism but practical solutions to contemporary problems. We must demonstrate that non-violence is not weakness but strength, that love is not sentimentality but wisdom.

The West has given the world science and technology, democracy and human rights. But it has also given us nationalism and imperialism, materialism and militarism. The challenge is to preserve what is valuable while discarding what is harmful.

Neither East nor West alone can create the new world order that we need. It requires a synthesis, a marriage of Eastern wisdom and Western energy, of ancient insights and modern knowledge, of spiritual depth and practical effectiveness.

The League of Nations is a step in the right direction, but it is only a first step. What we need is not just a league of governments but a league of peoples, not just political cooperation but cultural exchange, not just economic agreements but spiritual communion.

We need to create a new international culture that transcends national boundaries, a universal language that all can understand, a common purpose that all can share. This is not about destroying national cultures but about finding what unites us beneath what divides us.

The task is enormous, but it is not impossible. Every great transformation in human history began with a dream, a vision of what could be. The abolition of slavery once seemed impossible; so did the establishment of democracy; so did the conquest of disease. Yet all these were achieved because some people dared to dream and work for a better world.

Today we must dare to dream of a world without war, a world where conflicts are resolved through dialogue rather than violence, where resources are shared rather than hoarded, where cooperation replaces competition as the organizing principle of human society.

This dream will not be realized in our lifetime, perhaps not in our children's lifetime. But every step we take toward it, every effort we make to understand rather than to conquer, every act of love rather than hate, brings it closer to reality.

The cry for peace is not just a cry for the end of war; it is a cry for a new beginning, a new chapter in human history, a new hope for humanity. Let us answer this cry not with words alone but with our lives, not with promises alone but with our actions.

Peace is not a destination but a journey, not an achievement but a process, not a state but a way of being. Let us begin this journey today, in our own hearts, in our own homes, in our own communities. For the peace of the world begins with the peace in each human heart.
