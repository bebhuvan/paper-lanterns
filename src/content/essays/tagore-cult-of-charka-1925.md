Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray has marked me with his censure in printer's ink, for that I have been unable to display enthusiasm in the turning of the Charka. Let me confess to him that I am one of those unfortunate creatures who have failed to procure this particular grace.

I do not wish to disparage the Charka or belittle its importance. The spinning wheel has its place in the economic scheme of things, and for certain sections of our people, it may indeed provide useful employment and supplementary income. But to elevate it to the status of a panacea for all our economic ills, to make it the central symbol of our struggle for freedom—this seems to me to be a dangerous oversimplification.

The problem with the cult of the Charka is that it reduces a complex economic question to a simple moral formula. It suggests that if only we all spin for a certain number of hours each day, if only we wear nothing but hand-spun cloth, all our economic problems will be solved. But economic development is not so simple.

India's economic backwardness is not merely due to the import of foreign cloth. It is due to our lack of modern industries, our inadequate infrastructure, our insufficient capital, our limited technical knowledge, our social rigidities, and our educational deficiencies. The Charka alone cannot address these fundamental problems.

Moreover, the emphasis on hand-spinning may actually retard our economic progress by diverting attention from more productive activities. If we spend our time and energy on activities that machines can do more efficiently, we will fall further behind the rest of the world, not catch up with it.

This is not to say that we should simply imitate Western industrialization without discrimination. We must find our own path of development, one that suits our conditions and values. But this path must be based on reason and realistic assessment of our needs, not on romantic attachment to traditional methods.

The danger of the Charka cult is that it appeals to sentiment rather than to reason. It plays on our nostalgia for a simpler past, our resentment against foreign domination, our desire for easy solutions to complex problems. But sentiment alone cannot solve economic problems.

I have the greatest respect for the Mahatma and his motives. His dedication to the poor, his emphasis on self-reliance, his insistence on the dignity of labor—these are noble ideals that deserve our support. But I cannot help feeling that his means are not always adequate to his ends.

The spinning wheel is a symbol, and symbols have their importance. But we must not confuse symbols with realities. The real work of economic development requires not just symbolic gestures but practical measures: education and training, capital formation and investment, technological innovation and adaptation, institutional reform and social change.

If we truly want to help the poor, we need to create productive employment for them, not merely provide them with make-work activities. If we truly want to achieve economic independence, we need to build modern industries and develop technical capabilities, not simply retreat into handicraft production.

The Charka movement also reflects a certain paternalistic attitude toward the masses. It assumes that simple activities like spinning are all that the common people are capable of, that they cannot be educated and trained for more skilled occupations. This seems to me to underestimate the potential of our people.

Our workers and farmers are not lacking in intelligence or capability. What they lack is opportunity—the opportunity to acquire skills, to access capital, to participate in modern economic activities. Our task should be to create these opportunities, not to confine them to traditional occupations.

Furthermore, the emphasis on self-sufficiency at the village level may actually increase inequality rather than reduce it. Villages that are well-endowed with resources and leadership will prosper, while those that are not will stagnate. What we need is not isolated self-sufficiency but integrated development that allows resources and opportunities to be shared.

I am not opposed to traditional crafts or cottage industries. They have their place in a balanced economy. But they should be promoted because they are economically viable and socially beneficial, not because they are traditional or symbolic.

The test of any economic policy should be: Does it increase productivity? Does it improve living standards? Does it provide genuine opportunities for advancement? Does it prepare us for the future? By these criteria, the Charka cult falls short.

What we need is not a cult but a strategy—a comprehensive strategy for economic development that combines the best of traditional wisdom with modern knowledge, that respects our values while embracing necessary changes, that serves our immediate needs while preparing for future challenges.

This strategy should include: education and skill development for our people; investment in infrastructure and modern industries; reform of outdated social and economic institutions; development of science and technology; creation of efficient markets and financial systems; and integration with the global economy on terms that serve our interests.

The spinning wheel may have a role to play in this strategy, but it cannot be the strategy itself. We need to think bigger, plan more comprehensively, and act more systematically if we are to solve our economic problems and achieve genuine prosperity for our people.

I hope that my criticism will be taken in the spirit in which it is offered—not as opposition to the Mahatma or his noble goals, but as a contribution to the debate about how best to achieve those goals. In a democracy, such debate is not only permissible but necessary.

The cause of India's freedom and prosperity is too important to be left to any single approach, however well-intentioned. It requires the best thinking and the combined efforts of all our people. Let us by all means honor the Charka, but let us not make it our only tool or our only hope.
