Generally speaking poetry may be divided into two classes: some of them are the individual utterances of their authors, others breathe the voice of a large community. The former class may again be divided into two groups. In one group, the poet gives expression to his purely personal emotions and experiences; in the other, his individual mind and consciousness merely serve as the medium through which the universal heart of humanity finds its voice.

The poetry of the first kind is limited in its scope; that of the second has a universal appeal. But both of them bear the stamp of the poet's personality. They give us the poet's own vision of life and the world. Through them we come to know not merely facts and events, but the poet's reaction to them, his interpretation of them.

But there is a third kind of poetry which does not bear the individual stamp of any particular poet. It is the voice of the people, the expression of the collective consciousness of a race or nation. Such poetry is not created; it grows. It is not the work of a day or a year, but of centuries. Generation after generation adds to it, modifies it, enriches it, till it becomes the scripture of a whole people.

To this class belong the great epics of the world—the Iliad and Odyssey of Greece, the Nibelungenlied of Germany, and the Ramayana and Mahabharata of India. These epics are not merely poems; they are the autobiography of a race, written by the race itself. They embody the ideals, aspirations, traditions, and wisdom of the people who created them.

The Ramayana is not merely the story of Rama; it is the story of the Indian people, their long pilgrimage through the ages in search of dharma, their ideal of righteousness. Through countless retellings, through infinite variations, the story has been shaped and reshaped by the collective imagination of India. Every generation has found in it something new, something relevant to its own struggles and aspirations.

What makes these epics eternal is not their literary excellence alone, though that is considerable, but their power to embody the deepest truths of human existence in forms that speak to the simplest heart. They deal with the fundamental problems of life—duty and desire, love and renunciation, the individual and society, man and destiny.

In the Ramayana, we see the ideal of duty carried to its highest point. Rama's adherence to his father's word, Sita's devotion to her husband, Bharata's renunciation of the throne, Lakshmana's brotherly loyalty—these are not merely individual virtues but the collective ideals of a civilization. They represent what India has always aspired to be, even when it has fallen short of these ideals.

But the epic is not a mere catalogue of virtues. It recognizes the complexity of human nature, the conflicts and contradictions that make up life. Ravana is not simply a demon but a learned Brahmin, a devoted son, a capable ruler. His tragedy lies not in his being evil incarnate but in allowing one weakness—his passion for Sita—to override all his virtues.

This complexity, this refusal to paint in simple black and white, is what gives the epic its universal appeal. It speaks not to a particular age or culture but to humanity itself. The problems it deals with are the eternal problems of human existence; the solutions it offers are not prescriptions but suggestions, not commands but examples.

The epic tradition in India is not dead history but living reality. The stories are retold in every generation, in every language, in every medium. From the Sanskrit of Valmiki to the Tamil of Kamban, from the Hindi of Tulsidas to the Bengali of Krittibas, each retelling adds something new while preserving the essential spirit.

This is the miracle of India's epics—they are both ancient and modern, both fixed and fluid, both particular and universal. They belong to India, yet they speak to the world. They were created in the past, yet they are constantly being recreated in the present.

In our modern age, when we are in danger of losing touch with our roots, when the pressure of Western civilization threatens to overwhelm our indigenous culture, these epics serve as anchors. They remind us who we are, where we come from, what we stand for. They are not relics of a dead past but fountains of living water from which each generation can drink and be refreshed.

But we must not make the mistake of treating them as museum pieces, to be preserved unchanged and worshipped from afar. The epic tradition is a living tradition. It must grow and evolve with the times. Each generation must discover its own meaning in these ancient stories, must find its own truth in these eternal tales.

The Ramayana is not one story but a thousand stories. It is not one truth but all truths. It is not the voice of one poet but the voice of India itself, speaking through the ages, telling us not what we were but what we can be, not where we have been but where we are going.

This is the glory of India's epic tradition—it is both memory and prophecy, both history and vision, both the past preserved and the future imagined. In understanding this tradition, we understand not merely our literature but our civilization, not merely our art but our soul.
