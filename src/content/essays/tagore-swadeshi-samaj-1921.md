In our country the king has made wars, defended his territory and administered his laws, but the social organisation has attended to everything else, from the supply of water to the supply of knowledge, from the care of health to the care of morals, from the production of necessities to the creation of luxuries.

This social organisation was not created by the king; it grew from below. It was not imposed by authority; it evolved through custom and tradition. It was not uniform throughout the country; it varied according to local needs and conditions. Yet it held the country together with bonds stronger than any political unity.

When we speak of Swadeshi, we must understand what we mean. Do we mean merely the use of Indian-made goods? Do we mean merely the boycott of foreign articles? Or do we mean something deeper—the revival and strengthening of our own social organisation, our own methods of production and distribution, our own systems of education and culture?

The true meaning of Swadeshi is self-reliance—not merely economic self-reliance, but social, cultural, and spiritual self-reliance. It means the building up of our own society on our own foundations, according to our own ideals and in harmony with our own traditions.

Our village communities were perfect examples of Swadeshi organisation. They were self-sufficient, self-governing, and self-reliant. They produced what they needed and needed what they produced. They educated their children, cared for their sick, maintained their religion, and preserved their culture. They were connected with the larger world, but they were not dependent on it.

The destruction of these village communities by foreign rule has been one of the greatest disasters in our history. The village artisan was displaced by the factory; the village school was replaced by the government college; the village assembly was superseded by the district court. The organic unity of our society was broken, and we became a mass of disconnected individuals, dependent on alien institutions for our very existence.

The revival of Swadeshi means the rebuilding of this organic unity. It means the restoration of the village community as the basic unit of our society. It means the revival of cottage industries, not as a romantic return to the past, but as a practical solution to our economic problems.

But Swadeshi is not merely an economic programme; it is a social and cultural revolution. It means the awakening of our people to their own strength, their own dignity, their own worth. It means the rediscovery of our own traditions, not as dead weight from the past, but as living forces for the future.

The spinning wheel is not merely an instrument for producing cloth; it is a symbol of self-reliance, a means of meditation, a way of connecting with our roots. When a man spins, he not only produces what he needs; he also discovers his own creative power, his own dignity as a worker.

Education must be Swadeshi too. We must educate our children not to be clerks in foreign offices but to be creators of their own destiny. We must teach them not merely to read and write but to think and create. We must give them not merely information but wisdom, not merely knowledge but understanding.

Our art, our literature, our music must also be Swadeshi. They must spring from our own soil, reflect our own life, express our own aspirations. They must not be pale imitations of foreign models but original creations rooted in our own culture.

But Swadeshi does not mean isolation or narrow nationalism. It means strength through self-reliance, the capacity to give as well as to receive. A nation that is dependent cannot contribute; only a nation that is self-reliant can enrich the world.

The river that springs from its own source can flow to the sea and give its waters to all humanity. But a river that depends on borrowed waters will soon dry up. We must find our own springs, dig our own wells, build our own channels.

Swadeshi is not against the world; it is for the world. But it recognizes that we can serve the world only when we are strong in ourselves, only when we have something of our own to give. A beggar cannot be a benefactor; only a man who has can share with others.

The present moment is crucial for our Swadeshi movement. We stand at the crossroads between dependence and independence, between slavery and freedom, between death and life. The choice is ours, but we must choose quickly and choose rightly.

If we choose dependence, we will become a people without a past and without a future, living on the charity of others, contributing nothing to the sum of human progress. If we choose independence through Swadeshi, we will become a creative force in the world, enriching humanity with our unique contribution.

The path of Swadeshi is not easy. It requires sacrifice, discipline, and patience. It requires the courage to break with comfortable habits, the strength to build new institutions, the wisdom to preserve what is valuable while discarding what is harmful.

But it is the only path that leads to true freedom—not merely political freedom, but social, economic, cultural, and spiritual freedom. It is the path that leads not merely to independence but to excellence, not merely to survival but to greatness.

Let us walk this path with confidence and determination, knowing that we are not merely serving ourselves but serving humanity, not merely saving our nation but contributing to the progress of the world.
