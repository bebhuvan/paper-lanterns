My dear Professor Einstein,

If there be some truth which has no sensuous or rational relation to the human mind, it will ever remain as nothing so long as we remain human beings. The word 'real' is a human word and its meaning is related to human experience.

You say that there are two different types of existence - one independent of human consciousness and another which is empirical reality. I cannot but think that these are two aspects of the same reality. It is the human mind which gives unity to this world and constructs it into a cosmos.

The world as we know it is a human world. Even when we speak of non-human worlds, they are human conceptions of non-human worlds. The universe that is not related to human consciousness is inconceivable. This is not because of any limitation of our mind, but because of the very nature of truth itself.

What we call truth lies in the rational harmony between the subjective and objective aspects of reality, both of which belong to the super-personal man. Even the physical world is a world of relationship. Our scientific world is a human world - it is the dance of our consciousness with the cosmic consciousness.

The question is whether truth is independent of our consciousness. I cannot think of any truth which is completely independent of humanity. Even scientific truth is human truth. We can only apprehend truth through the human medium, and in that sense, all truth is human truth.

Beauty is in the ideal of perfect harmony which is in the universal being; truth the perfect comprehension of the universal mind. We individuals approach it through our own mistakes and blunders, through our accumulated experiences, through our illumined consciousness.

With profound respect and warm regards,

Rabindranath Tagore
