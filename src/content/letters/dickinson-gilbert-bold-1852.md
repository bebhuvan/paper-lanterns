I have dared to do strange things – bold things, and have asked no advice from any. I have heeded beautiful tempters, yet do not think I am wrong. Oh, I have needed my trusty Jane – my friend encourager, and sincere councillor, my rock, and strong assurance.

I go out very little now; somebody said that walking didn't help me, and I thought maybe they were right, and tried staying at home for a remedy. I don't walk so much as I used to – indeed I think I am rather more careful than I was.

The hills are far away, and the morning is so still – I hardly think the birds dare sing, lest they should break it. Now and then a farmer passes, and the wheels screech dismally. It is very much like some weird dream I have had, and I keep thinking I shall wake up soon, and be at home with you.

Sometimes I feel like a seed dropped in the wrong soil, waiting for the proper season to sprout. But perhaps there is no wrong soil – perhaps there are only souls not yet ready to bloom where they've been planted.

The world seems so large when you're young, Susie, and yet so small at the same time. Large enough to contain all our dreams, yet small enough that every choice feels momentous, every path untaken a universe lost.

Do you ever feel as though you're living in a chrysalis, waiting for some transformation that may never come? I find myself caught between the child I was and the woman I might become, uncertain which frightens me more – changing, or staying exactly as I am.
