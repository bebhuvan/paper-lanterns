Dearest Langston,

I write to you from this porch in Eatonville, where the evening air carries the voices of storytellers and the laughter of children playing games their grandmothers taught them. You asked about my folklore collecting, and I must tell you - it is both the most rewarding and most challenging work I have ever undertaken.

Folklore is not as easy to collect as it sounds. The best source is where there are the least outside influences, and these people, being underprivileged, are the shyest. They won't talk to you if they think you're trying to "study" them. You have to be one of them, laugh with them, cry with them, live their life.

Yesterday, I sat on Miss Lucy's porch shelling peas, and slowly, gradually, the stories began to flow. Tales of Brer Rabbit, yes, but also stories I'd never heard - about flying Africans, about conjure women who could call rain, about the time Death came to dinner and got outwitted by a clever widow. Each story carries within it the wisdom of generations, the way our people have made sense of joy and sorrow, triumph and betrayal.

What strikes me most is the poetry embedded in everyday speech. These folks don't know they're creating literature when they describe a sunset as "God's quilt spread across heaven's bed," or when they say a vain woman "thinks her dung smells like rose water." This is language alive, language that walks and breathes and dances.

The academics up North keep telling me I should focus on the "primitive" elements, the connections to Africa. But they miss the point entirely. This isn't primitive - it's sophisticated cultural adaptation. Our people took the fragments of what they remembered from across the ocean, mixed them with what they found in this new land, and created something entirely fresh and beautiful.

I've been recording the work songs from the turpentine camps, the ring shouts from the churches, the dozens played by young men on street corners. Each form serves a purpose - to make hard work bearable, to connect the community with the divine, to sharpen wit and build verbal dexterity. Nothing exists without reason in folk culture.

You know how some of our educated friends look down on this material? They want us to write like white poets, to prove we can master their forms. But why should we abandon gold to mine for copper? The stories I'm collecting contain more truth about the human condition than all the drawing-room poetry in the world.

Take the story of High John the Conqueror - here's a figure who wins through wit rather than violence, who transforms pain into laughter, who finds freedom in the most constrained circumstances. Isn't this figure more relevant to our experience than Greek gods or Nordic heroes?

I'm convinced that our folk culture contains the seeds of a truly American literature. Not imitation European, not trying to prove we're "civilized" by white standards, but something that grows directly from our soil, our struggle, our particular genius for survival and joy.

The children here still play games with roots in ancient rituals. The old women still know which herbs heal what ailments, which stories to tell when someone dies, which songs to sing when babies are born. This knowledge is disappearing, Langston. Every elder who dies takes a library with them.

That's why this work feels urgent. I'm not just collecting stories - I'm preserving a way of seeing, a way of being in the world that has sustained our people through unimaginable hardship. These tales remind us that we are not just survivors but creators, philosophers, artists who have always been here, making beauty from whatever materials we could find.

Sometimes, sitting in these country churches, listening to the preacher's sermon build like a symphony, watching the congregation sway and respond and participate in the creation of the moment, I think: this is what literature should be. Not something written for scholars to analyze, but something alive, something that makes community, something that changes the people who encounter it.

I hope you'll visit soon. I want you to hear these voices yourself, to feel how they transform ordinary speech into something approaching the sacred. Our people have always been poets - they just didn't write it down.

Your devoted friend and collaborator,
Zora

P.S. - I've enclosed a transcription of a story about why women's tongues are so sharp. Old Man Peterson told it last night, and even the stern church deacons were wiping tears of laughter from their eyes. This is what we must preserve - not just the words, but the joy.
