The only journey is the one within. Go into yourself. Find out the reason that commands you to write; see whether it has spread its roots into the very depths of your heart; confess to yourself whether you would have to die if you were forbidden to write.

My dear Mr. Kappus, you asked me whether your verses are any good. You ask me. You have asked others before this. You send them to magazines. You compare them with other poems, and you are upset when certain editors reject your work. Now I beg you to stop doing that. You are looking outside, and that is what you should most avoid right now.

There is only one thing you should do. Go into yourself. Find out the reason that commands you to write; see whether it has spread its roots into the very depths of your heart; confess to yourself whether you would have to die if you were forbidden to write. This most of all: ask yourself in the most silent hour of your night: must I write?

Dig into yourself for a deep answer. And if this answer rings out in assent, if you meet this solemn question with a strong, simple "I must," then build your life in accordance with this necessity; your whole life, even into its humblest and most indifferent hour, must become a sign and witness to this impulse.

Perhaps you are being too harsh with your poems. Perhaps you are not allowing them to ripen. Young things are often raw, and need time to develop. Do not be discouraged by rejection. Most editors have no sense for the new and genuine. They want what sells, what flatters the crowd, what causes no disturbance in their comfortable world.

But you—you must trust the slow work of your soul. You must give birth to your images. They are the future waiting within you. They are possibility becoming reality.

Do not believe that the person who seeks to comfort you now lives untroubled among the simple and quiet words that sometimes do you good. His life may also have much sadness and difficulty, that remains far beyond yours. Were it otherwise, he would never have been able to find these words.

The sadness that is in you now, the questioning, the doubt—these are not obstacles to your poetry, they are its very substance. Do not try to write love poems if you have never been in love. Begin with what is closest to you, most immediate, most necessary.

There is only one solitude, and it is vast, heavy, difficult to bear, and almost everyone has hours when he would gladly exchange it for any kind of sociability, however trivial or cheap, for the tiniest outward agreement with the first person who comes along.

But perhaps these are the very hours during which solitude grows; for its growing is painful as the growing of boys and sad as the beginning of spring. This need not discourage you. What is necessary, after all, is only this: solitude, vast inner solitude.

To go into oneself and meet no one for hours—that is what one must arrive at. To be solitary as one was as a child, when the grown-ups walked around involved with matters that seemed important and big because they looked so busy.

The future enters into us, in order to transform itself in us, long before it happens.
