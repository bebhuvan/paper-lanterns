about:
  context: "This letter was written as Addams and Starr were establishing Hull House, one of the first settlement houses in America. Settlement houses were community centers in poor neighborhoods that provided services and brought together people of different social classes. This letter outlines Addams's philosophy of social work and her vision for bridging class divides."
  significance: "This letter represents the birth of modern social work in America. Addams's approach emphasized living among the poor rather than dispensing charity from afar, understanding social problems through direct experience, and working for systemic change rather than just individual aid. Her settlement house model spread across America and influenced Progressive Era reforms."
  author_bio: "Jane Addams (1860-1935) was a pioneering American social worker, public philosopher, sociologist, and author. She co-founded Hull House in Chicago, one of the first settlement houses in the United States, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931. Her innovative approaches to social welfare and international peace made her a central figure in Progressive Era reform movements."
  recipient_info: "Ellen Gates Starr (1859-1940) was Addams's college friend and co-founder of Hull House. An educator and social reformer, she shared Addams's vision of bringing culture and education to working-class immigrants while learning from their experiences and wisdom."

My dear Ellen,

We must be free from that contempt which a lofty morality is so apt to feel toward the baser elements of society, and we must be ready to combine with many others in the world-wide efforts toward social progress.

As we prepare to open Hull House, I find myself thinking constantly about what we hope to accomplish. It is not enough to simply do good—anyone with a charitable heart can distribute soup and clothing. What we must do is something far more difficult: we must learn to see the world through the eyes of our neighbors.

The poor are not a problem to be solved, Ellen, but people to be understood. They have wisdom born of struggle, creativity born of necessity, and resilience that puts our middle-class comforts to shame. If we approach them as teachers rather than students, as experts rather than learners, we will fail before we begin.

I have been reading about Toynbee Hall in London, and I am struck by the humility of their approach. The university men who live there do not come as missionaries of culture, but as fellow seekers after truth. They offer what they have—education, connections, advocacy—while remaining open to what they might receive in return.

This must be our way too. We will offer classes in literature and art, yes, but we will also learn about the poetry of daily survival, the art of making much from little. We will advocate for better housing and working conditions, but we will also discover new forms of community and mutual aid that our own social class has forgotten.

The settlement house movement is not about charity, my dear friend—it is about democracy. It is about creating spaces where people of different classes can meet as equals, where the artificial barriers of society can be temporarily dissolved, where we can practice the kind of human fellowship that democracy requires but rarely achieves.

I know there will be those who think us foolish young women, playing at social work. But I believe we are part of something larger—a recognition that in an industrial age, the old forms of community have broken down, and new forms must be created. We cannot leave the poor to sink or swim alone while we live in comfortable isolation.

Your devoted friend,
Jane
