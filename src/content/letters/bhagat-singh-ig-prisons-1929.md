Subject: Request for Transfer to Lahore Central Jail

Sir,

I have the honor to request that I be transferred from Mianwali Jail to Lahore Central Jail at the earliest possible convenience.

I am scheduled to appear before the Sessions Court in Lahore on June 26, 1929, in connection with the Saunders shooting case. The hearing of this case is of utmost importance, and I need adequate time and facilities to prepare my defense.

Justice demands that every under trial should be given all those facilities which help him to prepare and contest the case. The present location of my imprisonment at Mianwali Jail presents several serious difficulties in this regard:

1. **Legal Representation**: The remote location of Mianwali makes it extremely difficult for me to consult with legal counsel. Lawyers from Lahore are reluctant to make the long journey to Mianwali for consultations, and this severely hampers my ability to prepare an adequate defense.

2. **Family Contact**: My family members, who are essential witnesses and sources of support in preparing my case, find it nearly impossible to visit me regularly due to the distance and lack of proper transportation facilities to Mianwali.

3. **Documentation and Evidence**: Important documents and evidence related to my case are located in Lahore. Access to these materials is crucial for preparing my defense, but the distance makes it practically impossible to review them properly.

4. **Communication Difficulties**: The isolation of Mianwali Jail severely limits my ability to correspond with people who might assist in my defense preparation.

I understand that security considerations are important, but I submit that these concerns can be adequately addressed at Lahore Central Jail, which has proper facilities for high-security prisoners. My transfer would not compromise security while ensuring that my fundamental right to a fair trial is protected.

I am not asking for any special privileges, merely for the basic facilities that any under-trial prisoner should have access to in order to prepare his defense. The principle of fair trial is fundamental to any system of justice, and I trust that the prison administration will uphold this principle.

The hearing date of June 26, 1929, is fast approaching, and any delay in my transfer will seriously prejudice my ability to present an adequate defense. I therefore request that this transfer be processed on an urgent basis.

I am prepared to comply with any additional security measures that may be deemed necessary during my stay at Lahore Central Jail. My only concern is to ensure that I receive a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of justice.

I hope that you will consider my request favorably and order my immediate transfer to Lahore Central Jail.

I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,

Bhagat Singh
Under Trial Prisoner
Mianwali Jail

Dated: June 17, 1929

P.S. - I would be grateful if this request could be processed at the earliest, as time is of the essence in this matter.
