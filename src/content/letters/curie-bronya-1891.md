My dear Bronya,

I have literally torn myself from Paris to write to you, so you can imagine how busy I am. It is true that I am entirely absorbed in my work. The idea of preparing for my degree fills me with joy. I could not live without the laboratory.

I am working in the laboratory of Professor Lippmann, and I am delighted with the progress I am making. Every day I understand better how much I still have to learn, but this, far from discouraging me, fills me with ardor.

I must tell you that I lead a very regular life. I get up at seven, have my breakfast, and then go to the laboratory where I stay until six o'clock. After dinner, I work again until ten or eleven o'clock. I am perfectly happy with this existence.

My room is very pleasant. I have everything I needâ€”a bed, a table, a chair, a washstand, and some shelves for my books. What more could I want? I am completely independent and free to arrange my life as I please.

The cold has been intense this winter, but I have managed quite well. My little iron stove heats the room sufficiently, and I have become quite expert at building fires. You would laugh to see me, but I am proud of my domestic accomplishments.

I dream of nothing but my studies. Science has become my passion, my life. Each new discovery fills me with such joy that I forget all the hardships.
