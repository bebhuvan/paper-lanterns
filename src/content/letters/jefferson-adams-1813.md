The same political parties which now agitate the United States have existed through all time. Whether the power of the people or that of the aristoi should prevail were questions which kept the states of Greece and Rome in eternal convulsions, as they now schismatize every people whose minds and mouths are not shut up by the gag of a despot.

And where this difference of opinion arises, as it does in our country, where no violence is used, where the same result is sought by the different parties, where the question is merely through which channel the waters of public happiness shall flow, this difference, instead of being a cause of concern, is in the order of nature and may even be useful.

Men by their constitutions are naturally divided into two parties: 1. Those who fear and distrust the people, and wish to draw all powers from them into the hands of the higher classes. 2. Those who identify themselves with the people, have confidence in them, cherish and consider them as the most honest and safe, although not the most wise depositary of the public interests.

In every country these two parties exist, and in every one where they are free to think, speak, and write, they will declare themselves. Call them, therefore, Liberals and Serviles, Jacobins and Ultras, Whigs and Tories, Republicans and Federalists, Aristocrats and Democrats, or by whatever name you please, they are the same parties still and pursue the same object.

The last one of Aristocrats and Democrats is the true one expressing the essence of all.
