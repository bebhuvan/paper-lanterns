My dearest father! I cannot write a letter in verse, for I am no poet. I cannot arrange the parts of speech with such art as to produce effects of light and shade, for I am no painter. Even by signs and gestures I cannot express my thoughts and feelings, for I am no dancer.

But I can do so by means of sounds, for I am a musician. Tomorrow I shall play to you on the pianoforte what I feel today. Music is my language, papa. It is the only way I know to speak what is truly in my heart.

You have asked about my prospects here in Mannheim. The Elector is very gracious, and the orchestra is excellent — the best I have ever heard. The oboes, clarinets, horns and bassoons are magnificent. But as for my income, well, that remains as uncertain as ever.

I must confess, dear father, that sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the weight of expectation. Everyone speaks of my 'gift' as though it were some magical thing I possess, rather than something I must work at every day with bleeding fingers and an aching back.

But when I sit at the keyboard, when the notes flow from my mind through my hands into the air, then I understand why God gave me this burden. For it is not a burden at all — it is the greatest joy I have ever known.

Please give my love to my dear sister. Tell her I am composing something special for her, something that will make her laugh and cry at the same time, if such a thing is possible in music. I believe it is.
