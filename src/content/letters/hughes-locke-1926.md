My Dear Professor Locke,

Your recent letter expressing concern about the direction of my latest poems compels me to clarify my artistic philosophy and defend what I believe to be the proper role of the Negro artist in American society. While I have the deepest respect for your scholarship and your dedication to advancing our race through cultural achievement, I must respectfully disagree with your counsel that we should always present the most refined and respectable aspects of Negro life.

We younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn't matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly too. The tom-tom cries and the tom-tom laughs. If colored people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, their displeasure doesn't matter either.

The urge within me is to write about the people I know best - the workers, the roustabouts, the singers and dancers in the cabarets, the ordinary folks who make up the vast majority of our race. These people have beauty and dignity and truth that I want to capture in my verse. Why should I apologize for finding poetry in their lives? Why should I pretend that the only Negroes worth writing about are those who approximate white middle-class respectability?

You have argued that our literature should always elevate the race, should combat negative stereotypes by presenting only positive images of Negro achievement and refinement. I understand this impulse, but I believe it leads to artistic dishonesty and actually reinforces the very prejudices we seek to overcome. When we suggest that working-class Negro life is somehow shameful and must be hidden, we accept white standards of respectability that diminish rather than celebrate our authentic culture.

The jazz clubs of Lenox Avenue, the house-rent parties in Harlem tenements, the churches where folks shout and sway - these are not embarrassments to be concealed but sources of artistic inspiration to be celebrated. The blues that pour from the lips of a tired woman after a day of domestic work contain more truth about the Negro experience than any drawing-room conversation about racial uplift.

I want to be a poet - not a Negro poet. That is, I want to write Negro poems about Negro life using Negro rhythms and idioms, but I want them to be judged as poetry first, not as racial propaganda. The moment we start writing primarily to prove something about our race rather than to express our individual artistic vision, we cease to be artists and become publicists.

The mountain standing in the way of any true Negro art in America is this urge within the race toward whiteness, the desire to pour racial individuality into the mold of American standardization, and to be as little Negro and as much American as possible. This is the mountain we must climb or perish attempting to climb if we would be free.

Consider the reception of my poem "The Weary Blues." Some Negro critics complained that I was perpetuating negative stereotypes by writing about a blues pianist in a Lenox Avenue club. But the white critics praised the poem for its authentic voice and rhythmic innovation. The irony is that in trying to protect the race's image, some of our own people would deny the artistic value of our most distinctive cultural expressions.

The younger generation of Negro writers - Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, Countee Cullen, and others - are not willing to sacrifice artistic truth for social respectability. We believe that the best way to serve our race is to create art that is honest, powerful, and beautiful, regardless of whether it confirms white expectations or Negro aspirations.

I think of the spirituals our ancestors created during slavery. Did they worry about whether white people would approve? Did they try to make their songs sound like European hymns? No - they poured their souls into their music and created something uniquely beautiful that now commands respect around the world. This is the tradition I want to continue.

The folk culture of working-class Negroes is rich with material for serious art. The dozens, the work songs, the blues, the jazz rhythms, the colorful speech patterns - these are not primitive survivals to be outgrown but sophisticated cultural achievements to be celebrated and refined through artistic treatment.

When I write about Susanna Jones coming down the road, or about the elevator boy dreaming of Africa, or about the woman whose man has left her singing the blues, I am not trying to embarrass our race. I am trying to capture the beauty and complexity of Negro life as I have observed it. These people have dignity, resilience, and wisdom that deserve artistic recognition.

The danger in your approach, Professor Locke, is that it asks Negro artists to become propagandists for racial advancement rather than explorers of human truth. While I certainly want my work to contribute to racial progress, I believe the most effective contribution is honest artistic expression rather than calculated image-management.

White readers will never truly respect Negro literature until they encounter Negro characters who are fully human - not plaster saints designed to prove racial worth, but complex individuals with strengths and weaknesses, virtues and flaws, dreams and disappointments. Only by presenting the full range of Negro humanity can we overcome the stereotypes that reduce us to caricatures.

I am also concerned that your emphasis on respectability inadvertently reinforces class divisions within our race. When middle-class Negro leaders distance themselves from working-class culture, they abandon the masses who most need leadership and inspiration. Art should bridge these divisions, not widen them.

The music that comes from rent parties and juke joints is not inferior to that produced in formal concert halls - it is different, and it serves different social functions. Both have value, and both deserve artistic treatment. My goal is to bring the rhythms and emotions of popular Negro music into serious poetry, creating a synthesis that is both artistically sophisticated and culturally authentic.

I envision a future when Negro artists will be free to write about any aspect of human experience without being held responsible for representing the entire race. But until that time comes, I choose to write about the aspects of Negro life that I know best and find most inspiring - the lives of ordinary people who create beauty and meaning despite oppression and hardship.

The Harlem Renaissance has given us unprecedented opportunities to develop Negro art and literature. Let us not waste this opportunity by limiting ourselves to safe, respectable subjects that offend no one and inspire no one. Let us be bold, authentic, and truthful, trusting that honest art will ultimately serve our race better than defensive propaganda.

I hope that despite our philosophical differences, you will continue to support the work of younger Negro writers who are exploring new directions in our literature. The conversation itself is valuable, and the diversity of approaches will ultimately strengthen rather than weaken Negro artistic achievement.

Yours in the struggle for artistic truth and racial progress,

Langston Hughes

P.S. - I am working on a new collection that incorporates even more jazz and blues rhythms into formal verse. I believe this synthesis represents the future direction of authentic Negro poetry, and I hope you will judge it on its artistic merits rather than its adherence to conventional respectability.
