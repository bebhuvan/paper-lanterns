A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction. That much is clear. But what I'm wondering now is whether she might need something more—the courage to write not as a woman or as a man, but as herself, whatever that mysterious self might be.

My dearest Vita, I have been thinking about our conversation yesterday regarding the peculiar difficulties that face women who wish to write, and I find myself returning again and again to this question of freedom—not just the obvious freedoms of money and privacy, but the subtler, more dangerous freedom of the mind.

You mentioned how difficult it is to find your authentic voice when the world insists on hearing you only as a woman writer, with all the diminishing implications that phrase carries. How right you are! The critics will always ask: Is this feminine enough? Is she too intellectual? Too political? Too passionate? As if our sex were a constraint to be managed rather than simply another aspect of human experience to be explored.

I have been imagining a sister of Shakespeare's—equally gifted, equally driven to write. What would have become of her? She would have been forbidden education, forbidden the stage, forbidden the taverns where ideas flourish and connections are made. If she had persisted in her ambition, she would have been called mad, locked away, or worse.

Yet here we are, Vita, you and I, carving out space for ourselves in this world that was not designed for us. Your gardens at Sissinghurst are as much an act of creation as any novel; my stream-of-consciousness experiments are as revolutionary as any political manifesto. We are writing ourselves into existence, word by word, thought by thought.

But it costs us, doesn't it? The constant vigilance required to protect our working time from the demands of domesticity. The need to justify our seriousness to men who assume our writing is merely a charming hobby. The exhausting internal battle against the voices that tell us we are not important enough, not profound enough, not universal enough.

Sometimes I feel like I am writing against a great silence—the silence of all the women who came before us, who had stories to tell but no one to listen, who had insights to share but no platform from which to speak. Their unwritten books haunt me. Their silenced voices demand that we speak not only for ourselves but for them.

This is why I am so passionate about our press, about publishing other women's work alongside the experimental male writers everyone expects us to champion. We must create the conditions under which women can write—not just the material conditions of rooms and money, but the cultural conditions of respect and serious attention.

Your love, darling Vita, has taught me something crucial about this freedom I seek. In your arms, in your understanding, I have found a space where I can be wholly myself—neither the dutiful wife nor the eccentric bluestocking, but simply Virginia. This personal liberation feels connected to the artistic liberation I struggle toward in my writing.

Perhaps this is what we women need most: not just rooms of our own, but relationships that honor our complexity, our contradictions, our refusal to be contained within conventional categories. We need lovers and friends who see us as we are—ambitious, sexual, intellectual, creative beings whose desires cannot be reduced to the roles society has prescribed for us.

The future I envision is one where women write freely about everything—love and war, politics and psychology, the public sphere and the private heart. Where our books are judged not as women's books but simply as books. Where the phrase "woman writer" becomes as redundant as "man writer."

Until then, we must continue this work of liberation—room by room, word by word, kiss by kiss.
