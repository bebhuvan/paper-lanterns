about:
  context: "This letter, sent from Madras to Cambridge University on January 16, 1913, introduced the world to one of the greatest mathematical minds in history. Ramanujan, a self-taught Indian clerk, reached out to G.H. Hardy with over 120 mathematical theorems and formulas."
  significance: "This correspondence launched one of mathematics' most famous collaborations. Hardy recognized Ramanujan's extraordinary talent and arranged for him to come to Cambridge, where their partnership produced groundbreaking work in number theory and mathematical analysis."
  author_bio: "Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) was a largely self-taught Indian mathematician who made remarkable contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Despite having little formal training, he rediscovered centuries of Western mathematics on his own and made original discoveries that are still studied today."
  recipient_info: "G.H. Hardy (1877-1947) was a prominent British mathematician at Cambridge University. He was known for his work in number theory and mathematical analysis, and became Ramanujan's mentor and collaborator during their time together at Cambridge."

Dear Sir,

I beg to introduce myself to you as a clerk in the Accounts Department of the Port Trust Office at Madras on a salary of only £20 per annum. I am now about 23 years of age. I have had no University education but I have undergone the ordinary school course. After leaving school I have been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at Mathematics.

I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed in a University course, but I am striking out a new path for myself. I have made a special investigation of divergent series in general and the results I get are termed by the local mathematicians as "startling."

Just as in elementary mathematics you give a meaning to a^n when n is negative and fractional to conform to the law which holds when n is a positive integer, so in the theory of divergent series I give a meaning to many divergent series to conform to the results given by convergent series, when the latter have a meaning.

I would request you to go through the enclosed papers. Being poor, if you are convinced that there is anything of value I would like to have my theorems published. I have not given the actual investigations nor the expressions that I get but I have indicated the lines on which I proceed. Being inexperienced I would very highly value any advice you give me.

I am sending you with this letter some of my results. I have found a function which exactly represents the number of prime numbers less than any given number. The functions I got are far more elegant than the well-known approximate formulae for the number of primes.

If you think that the results I have obtained are of sufficient merit to be published, I would be grateful if you could bring them to the notice of mathematicians. I am particularly eager to know if my method for summation of series are new.

I remain, Dear Sir,
Yours truly,

S. Ramanujan
