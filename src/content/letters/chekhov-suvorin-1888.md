about:
  context: "Anton Chekhov wrote this letter to Alexey Suvorin, a wealthy newspaper publisher and his close friend and patron, in September 1888. At this time, Chekhov was practicing medicine while simultaneously establishing himself as one of Russia's most important literary voices. Suvorin had apparently advised Chekhov to abandon medicine and focus solely on writing. This letter contains Chekhov's famous response defending his dual vocation."
  significance: "This letter contains one of the most memorable metaphors in literary history about balancing multiple vocations. Chekhov's comparison of medicine to a 'lawful wife' and literature to a 'mistress' reveals his playful yet serious commitment to both professions. The letter demonstrates how Chekhov viewed his medical practice not as a hindrance to his writing but as essential to it—providing discipline, real-world experience, and a break from the mental demands of creative work. This philosophy influenced his entire literary output; his medical training gave him acute psychological insight and his stories often feature doctors and patients."
  author_bio: "Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (1860-1904) qualified as a physician in 1884 and continued practicing medicine throughout much of his literary career. He famously treated peasants for free during cholera epidemics and established clinics. Despite his medical work, he wrote hundreds of short stories and major plays including 'The Seagull,' 'Uncle Vanya,' 'Three Sisters,' and 'The Cherry Orchard.' His stories are celebrated for their lack of moralizing, their compassion, and their realistic portrayal of Russian life. Chekhov's dual career as doctor and writer gave him unique insight into human nature and suffering."
  recipient_info: "Alexey Sergeyevich Suvorin (1834-1912) was a prominent Russian newspaper publisher, editor, and theatre critic who owned the conservative newspaper Novoye Vremya (New Time). He became Chekhov's friend, publisher, and patron in the mid-1880s, publishing many of Chekhov's early stories. Their friendship was complex—they disagreed politically (Suvorin was conservative, Chekhov more liberal) but maintained a close correspondence. Suvorin encouraged Chekhov's literary ambitions and their letters reveal the development of Chekhov's literary philosophy and technique."

You advise me not to hunt after two hares, and not to think of medical work. I do not know why one should not hunt two hares even in the literal sense…. I feel more confident and more satisfied with myself when I reflect that I have two professions and not one. Medicine is my lawful wife and literature is my mistress. When I get tired of one I spend the night with the other. Though it's disorderly, it's not so dull, and besides neither of them loses anything from my infidelity.

If I did not have my medical work I doubt if I could have given my leisure and my spare thoughts to literature. There is no discipline in me.
