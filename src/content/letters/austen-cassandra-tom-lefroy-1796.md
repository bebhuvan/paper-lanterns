Steventon, Saturday (January 16, 1796).

My dear Cassandra,

You scold me so much in the nice long letter which I have this moment received from you, that I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together. I can expose myself, however, only once more, because he leaves the country soon after next Friday, on which day we are to have a dance at Ashe after all. He is a very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man, I assure you. But as to our having ever met, except at the three last balls, I cannot say much; for he is so excessively laughed at about me at Ashe, that he is ashamed of coming to Steventon, and ran away when we called on Mrs. Lefroy a few days ago.

We have had charming weather for the time of year, and have taken some very pleasant walks. Yesterday was a very pleasant day, and we had a very pleasant walk. I hope it will be continued, for we have many very pleasant walks to take, and must feel anxious to take them.

I mean to confine myself in future to Mr. Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't care sixpence. This is Saturday night, and I have not yet told you anything about Friday. I went to Alton on Friday, and had a very pleasant day with the Biggs. We had a very comfortable dinner, and in the evening danced two dances, and sat down two others. There were twenty dances, and I danced them all, and without any fatigue. My black cap was openly admired by Mrs. Lefroy, and secretly I imagine by everybody else in the room.

Friday. At length the day is come on which I am to flirt my last with Tom Lefroy, and when you receive this it will be over. My tears flow as I write at the melancholy idea. Mrs. Lefroy tells everybody that I am in love with him, and I am obliged to make the best of it and to flirt with all the others to persuade people that I am equally in love with them all.

I took up this letter to write something more, and I am afraid I have written a great deal about nothing; but I shall put it in the fire if I write much longer. I have just heard from Martha, and Frank comes today. I want to see him before he sets off for foreign parts. The ball at Ashe which I mentioned to you was a smaller thing than I expected. There were only twelve dances, but the company was good, and we had a very pleasant evening.

Tell Mary that I make over Mr. Heartley and all his estate to her for her sole use and benefit in future, and not only him, but all my other admirers into the bargain wherever she can find them, even the kiss which C. Powlett wanted to give me, as I mean to confine myself in future to Mr. Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't care sixpence.

Assure her also, as a last resource, that if all else fails she will be secure of making at least one conquest at the next ball we attend. Tell her, with my love, that if she will come and see me I will give her as many particulars of balls, and dresses, and partners as she can reasonably desire, and perhaps a few unreasonable ones into the bargain.

Adieu. Give my best love to Mary, and tell her that I am very much obliged to her for her letter; it made me laugh heartily. But I must not depend upon her letters when I get to Bath; you will tell her so, with my love.

Yours affectionately,
Jane
