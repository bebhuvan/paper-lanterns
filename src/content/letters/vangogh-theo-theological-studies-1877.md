Amsterdam, 18 August 1877.

My dear Theo,

I long to write to you again, perhaps it will be a rather long time before we see each other. Shall we spend Christmas together in Etten? I hope so with all my heart.

You will have heard that I am working diligently here. I am now composing in Latin and Greek, and am also busy with French; later I shall take up German. If I study systematically it will not be too difficult, though there is much, very much to be done. But "peu à peu l'oiseau fait son nid," and:

"Polissez-le sans cesse et le repolissez,
Ajoutez quelquefois, et souvent effacez."

The meaning of these lines by Boileau is: Polish it all the time, and polish it again—add sometimes, and often take away—in short, work, take pains, that is what one must do.

Yesterday I was in Utrecht, and visited the cathedral and the university. That Gothic building is quite a wonderful one. How beautiful it must be there when the organ sounds through those stone arches during a service. I think often of that text, "I was glad when they said unto me, We will go into the house of the Lord."

In one of the bookshops I found a German book, Gottfried Keller's "Romeo und Julia auf dem Dorfe" (Romeo and Juliet in the Village). Do you know it? I am going to read it when I get the time.

I was also at cousin Hendrik's wedding reception. It was quite lively, with many relatives present. Aunt and Uncle Stricker were very kind to me, and I spent the evening pleasantly enough, though I could not help thinking how different such gatherings were from the quiet evenings we used to spend together at home.

The studies go on steadily. Mathematics is not easy for me, but I am persevering. Uncle Stricker helps me with the Greek, and his son Jan gives me Latin lessons twice a week. I get up early in the mornings to study, and the evenings are spent with texts and translations. Sometimes I feel the weight of it all, but then I remember Father's words about patience and persistence.

There is something beautiful about this old city of Amsterdam, with its canals and gables. I often take walks in the evening and observe the light on the water, the way it changes with the clouds. These moments give me peace and help me to reflect on the path I am taking.

I read a great deal in the Bible, and I find comfort there. The psalms especially speak to me during these days of preparation. "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want"—how these words sustain me when the work seems heavy.

Do you remember our walks together in the Brabant countryside? I think of them often now, and how we used to talk about our futures. Life takes us on such different paths than we imagine when we are young.

Please write to me soon and tell me all about your work at the gallery. Are there new paintings that have impressed you? I am curious about your thoughts on the exhibitions, and whether you have discovered any new artists of promise.

Give my love to everyone at home. Tell Father that I am working hard at my studies, and that I think often of his sermons and the way he prepares them with such care. That example guides me in my own preparation for this calling.

I hope to hear from you before long, dear brother. Your letters always bring me such joy and encouragement.

With much love,
Vincent

P.S.—I am enclosing a small pressed flower I found during one of my walks by the canals. It reminds me of the flowers we used to gather as children in the fields near Zundert.
