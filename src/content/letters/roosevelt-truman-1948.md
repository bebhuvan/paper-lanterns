Dear Mr. President,

Today marks a historic milestone in humanity's long struggle for dignity and justice. The United Nations General Assembly has adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by a vote of 48 to 0, with 8 abstentions. As I write this letter in the quiet of my UN office, I am filled with both pride in what we have accomplished and soberness about the challenges that lie ahead.

Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home - so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yet they are the world of the individual person; the neighborhood he lives in; the school or college he attends; the factory, farm, or office where he works. Such are the places where every man, woman, and child seeks equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without discrimination. Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere.

The process of drafting this Declaration has been one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my public life. For nearly two years, representatives from 18 nations with vastly different political systems, religious traditions, and cultural backgrounds have worked to find common ground on what it means to be human. The debates have been intense, sometimes heated, but always conducted with the recognition that we were crafting something unprecedented in human history.

The Soviet representatives consistently tried to weaken provisions protecting individual freedoms, while some Western delegates wanted to emphasize property rights over social and economic rights. Developing nations pushed for stronger language on self-determination and economic development. Through it all, we had to balance competing visions of human dignity while creating a document that could command broad international support.

I am particularly proud that we were able to include both civil and political rights alongside economic, social, and cultural rights. The Declaration recognizes that human dignity requires not only freedom from government oppression but also access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunity. A hungry person is not free, regardless of their political rights. A person denied education cannot fully participate in democratic society.

The abstentions today came from the Soviet bloc, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia - each objecting to different provisions for their own reasons. The Soviets claimed our emphasis on individual rights ignored collective social responsibilities. South Africa objected to the racial equality provisions that challenge their apartheid system. Saudi Arabia could not accept the article on freedom of religion and the right to change one's faith.

These objections remind us that the Declaration, while morally powerful, remains aspirational rather than legally binding. We have created a standard by which to measure progress, not a magic wand that will instantly transform the world. The real work begins now - translating these principles into national laws and international treaties with enforcement mechanisms.

I have been deeply moved by the support we received from smaller nations who see this Declaration as protection against the power of larger states. The representatives from newly independent countries in Asia and Africa spoke eloquently about their peoples' struggles against colonialism and their hopes that international law might prevent future oppression.

The inclusion of women's rights as human rights required constant vigilance throughout the drafting process. Several delegates initially objected to language ensuring equal rights regardless of sex, arguing that different cultures had different traditions regarding women's roles. I had to remind them repeatedly that human rights are universal or they are not human rights at all.

The economic and social rights articles proved particularly controversial among some American business leaders and congressional Republicans who fear they might lead to socialism. I have tried to explain that recognizing a right to education or healthcare does not dictate how a society provides these goods - only that every person deserves access to them through whatever means their society chooses.

Article 18, protecting freedom of religion and belief, reflects one of America's greatest contributions to human liberty. But even this seemingly straightforward right sparked debate when we discussed the right to change one's religion - something forbidden in some societies. We held firm that genuine religious freedom must include the right to choose one's beliefs.

The right to seek asylum from persecution, enshrined in Article 14, takes on special meaning given the refugee crisis following the war. Millions of displaced persons still seek homes and safety. This Declaration establishes their moral claim to protection, even if it cannot guarantee they will receive it.

I want to emphasize to you the importance of American leadership in implementing these principles at home. We cannot advocate for human rights internationally while tolerating racial segregation, denying women equal opportunities, or allowing economic inequality to undermine human dignity in our own country. The world is watching to see whether we will live up to the standards we helped create.

The Declaration's prohibition on discrimination based on race, color, sex, language, religion, political opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status directly challenges Jim Crow laws and other forms of institutionalized discrimination. Southern senators may object, but moral leadership requires consistency between our international commitments and domestic practices.

Some critics argue that the Declaration goes too far in recognizing economic and social rights that require government action to fulfill. They prefer limiting human rights to negative rights - things government cannot do to people - rather than positive rights that require government to provide services or opportunities. But the Commission concluded that human dignity requires both freedom from oppression and access to life's necessities.

The educational provisions in Article 26 deserve special attention as we consider America's future. The Declaration calls for education that promotes "understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups." This vision of education as a tool for building peace and cooperation should guide our approach to both domestic and international educational exchanges.

I have been struck by how this process has changed my own understanding of human rights. Working with colleagues from every continent has shown me that while the specific challenges facing different peoples may vary, the fundamental human desire for dignity, security, and opportunity is truly universal.

The adoption of this Declaration represents hope for future generations who may live in a world where human rights are not privileges granted by benevolent rulers but recognized as inherent to human nature itself. Whether that hope is fulfilled depends on the actions of governments, organizations, and individuals in the years ahead.

I close with gratitude for your support during this challenging process. There were moments when political pressures might have led a less principled president to withdraw American participation or water down our commitments. Your steadfast backing allowed us to maintain moral leadership at this crucial moment in history.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is now part of humanity's common heritage. May it serve as a beacon guiding us toward the more perfect world that remains our shared responsibility to create.

Eleanor Roosevelt

P.S. - I am already receiving requests to help draft treaties that would make specific rights legally binding under international law. This work will require continued American leadership and your continued support. The Declaration is only the first step in building an international system of human rights protection.
