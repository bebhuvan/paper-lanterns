Dear Martha,

Your recent letter about the philosophical foundations of our capability approach has prompted me to reflect more deeply on what I believe may be a fundamental reconceptualization of how we think about human development and well-being. I want to share with you some thoughts that have been crystallizing as I observe the persistent inadequacy of traditional economic measures in capturing what truly matters for human flourishing.

Development consists of the removal of various types of unfreedoms that leave people with little choice and little opportunity of exercising their reasoned agency. This simple statement, I believe, captures something essential that has been missing from decades of development economics focused primarily on income growth, industrialization, and technological modernization.

When we observe the lived reality of people in developing countries - and indeed in developed countries as well - we see that income or GDP per capita tells us remarkably little about their actual opportunities to live the kinds of lives they have reason to value. A person may have adequate income but lack access to education, healthcare, or political participation. Conversely, someone with modest income might enjoy rich social relationships, meaningful work, and genuine political voice.

This disconnect has led me to think about development in terms of capabilities - the substantive freedoms that people have to lead the kinds of lives they have reason to value. The capability approach asks not just "how much income do people have?" but "what are they actually able to do and be?"

Consider the difference between a person who is well-nourished and someone who is fasting by choice. In terms of nutritional intake, they may appear identical, but their situations are fundamentally different because one exercises agency while the other lacks the capability to choose. Development should be concerned with expanding the range of choices available to people, not just ensuring particular outcomes.

This perspective has profound implications for how we measure and pursue development. Instead of focusing solely on economic indicators, we should examine whether people have the capabilities for basic functionings - adequate nutrition, shelter, healthcare, education - as well as more complex capabilities like political participation, cultural expression, and social affiliation.

The measurement challenges are considerable but not insurmountable. We already collect data on literacy rates, life expectancy, infant mortality, and political freedoms. What we need is a more systematic framework for understanding how these various dimensions of human capability interact and reinforce each other.

I have been working on what might become a Human Development Index that would combine measures of health, education, and income to provide a more rounded picture of development progress. This is still preliminary, but I believe such composite measures could revolutionize how governments and international organizations think about development priorities.

The gender dimension is particularly crucial to this approach. Traditional development economics often overlooked the systematic disadvantages faced by women and girls, treating households as unified decision-making units. The capability approach reveals how gender inequality constrains human development even in societies with rising average incomes.

When women lack access to education, reproductive choice, or economic opportunities, this represents a massive waste of human potential that holds back entire societies. Development strategies that ignore gender inequality inevitably fall short of their potential for enhancing human welfare.

The policy implications extend far beyond women's issues. A capability-focused approach suggests that public investment in education, healthcare, and social services may be more important for genuine development than policies focused solely on economic growth. This doesn't mean growth is unimportant, but that it should be valued instrumentally rather than as an end in itself.

Democracy and political freedoms also take on new significance in this framework. The capability to participate in public decisions that affect one's life is intrinsically valuable, not just instrumentally useful for achieving other development goals. Political freedoms also tend to support other capabilities by ensuring that public policies respond to people's actual needs and priorities.

I have been studying the relationship between famines and political systems, and the evidence strongly suggests that democratic countries with free press and competitive elections do not experience famines, even when they face severe food shortages. This demonstrates how political capabilities can be literally life-saving, not just abstractly important.

The international development community has been remarkably resistant to these ideas, preferring the apparent precision of income-based measures to the complexity of capability assessment. But I believe this resistance reflects conceptual confusion rather than legitimate methodological concerns.

We regularly make complex judgments about human welfare in other contexts. Medical professionals assess health using multiple indicators, educators evaluate learning through various measures, and even businesses use balanced scorecards rather than single metrics. Why should development economics be uniquely wedded to unidimensional measures?

The universalism debate is more challenging. Critics argue that capabilities-based approaches impose particular values or ways of life on diverse cultures. This concern deserves serious attention, but I believe it can be addressed without abandoning the basic framework.

The key insight is that the capability approach focuses on freedoms and opportunities rather than specific choices or outcomes. Different cultures may value different activities and ways of life, but the underlying capabilities - for health, education, social participation, and so forth - provide the foundation for pursuing any reasonable conception of the good life.

Cultural diversity should be celebrated and protected, but not at the expense of basic human capabilities. The fact that different societies have different traditions does not justify denying education to girls, preventing political participation, or accepting preventable disease and malnutrition.

Your work on the role of emotions and care in moral philosophy has helped me think more clearly about the motivational foundations of the capability approach. Pure rational choice theory cannot explain why people often act altruistically or why societies invest in public goods that provide diffuse benefits.

The capability approach implicitly assumes that people care about others' well-being and are willing to support institutions that enhance collective capabilities. This assumption seems empirically reasonable and normatively attractive, but it does require us to move beyond the narrow self-interest models that dominate economic theory.

I am increasingly convinced that the capability approach has applications beyond international development. Inequality in wealthy countries, the situation of disadvantaged minorities, the treatment of elderly and disabled people - all these issues can be illuminated by asking what capabilities different groups actually have rather than just comparing incomes or other simple measures.

The theoretical work we have been doing together on practical reason and human flourishing provides crucial philosophical foundations for these applications. The capability approach needs rigorous philosophical grounding to avoid becoming merely a laundry list of desirable outcomes without coherent organizing principles.

I believe we are developing a framework that could transform not just development policy but social policy more broadly. By focusing on what people are actually able to do and be, rather than just their income or consumption levels, we can design more effective and humane approaches to promoting human welfare.

The resistance we encounter from some economists reflects deeper disagreements about the nature of value and the purposes of economic analysis. Many of our colleagues remain committed to approaches that treat preferences as given and focus on efficiency in satisfying those preferences, regardless of their content or origins.

But this approach becomes problematic when preferences themselves are shaped by deprivation, discrimination, or limited information. The rural woman who never attended school and accepts her subordinate status may express satisfaction with her situation, but this should not lead us to conclude that gender inequality is unproblematic in her community.

The capability approach provides tools for making these distinctions while respecting human agency and diversity. We can simultaneously affirm the importance of individual choice while recognizing that some choices are made under constrained circumstances that limit their significance as expressions of genuine preferences.

I hope our continued collaboration will help develop these ideas further and demonstrate their practical value for addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing human societies. The integration of rigorous economic analysis with philosophically sophisticated thinking about human flourishing may offer new possibilities for both theoretical understanding and policy innovation.

The timing seems propitious for such work. The limitations of purely growth-focused development strategies are becoming increasingly apparent, while new data and analytical techniques make capability assessment more feasible than ever before. Perhaps we can contribute to a fundamental shift in how human societies think about progress and well-being.

With warm regards and anticipation of our continued intellectual partnership,

Amartya

P.S. - I have been invited to present these ideas to the United Nations Development Programme next month. If our framework gains acceptance there, it could influence how development assistance is designed and evaluated worldwide. The potential for practical impact makes the theoretical work feel even more urgent and important.
