My dear Sister,

I hope you are keeping well and in good spirits. I received your letter and was very glad to hear from you.

Do not come to Lahore until you receive another letter from me. Battu has been transferred to another jail and his separation has become unbearable for me. I do not know when they will bring him back or if they will bring him back at all.

You know how close Battu and I have become during these months in prison. He is not just a comrade to me but a friend more dear than my brothers. We have shared our thoughts, our hopes, our fears, and our dreams for our country's future. To be separated from him at this critical time is one of the hardest trials I have had to face.

I understand your anxiety to see your brother, and I share that anxiety. But traveling all this way only to find that he is not here would cause you unnecessary hardship and disappointment. It is better to wait until I can give you definite information about his whereabouts.

I want you to know that Battu has been bearing his imprisonment with remarkable courage and dignity. He has not let the hardships of jail life break his spirit or dim his revolutionary fervor. You should be proud of him. He speaks of you often and misses you greatly, but he knows that our cause demands these sacrifices.

Please keep courage, dear sister. These are testing times for all of us, but we must remember that every sacrifice we make brings our country one step closer to freedom. The tears we shed today will water the tree of liberty that our children will enjoy.

I know it is difficult for families like ours. We have chosen a path that brings suffering not only to ourselves but to our loved ones. But I believe that this suffering is not in vain. Future generations will remember that there were people who were willing to give up everything for the sake of their motherland.

Take care of your health and do not worry too much about Battu or about me. We are both strong and determined, and we will face whatever comes with courage. Our spirits remain unbroken, and our faith in our cause remains unshaken.

I hope to have better news for you soon. Until then, please be patient and keep yourself strong. Battu will need your strength when he is finally able to meet you.

Give my respects to all the family members and tell them that we are fighting not just for ourselves but for all the mothers and sisters of India who suffer under foreign rule.

Your brother,
Bhagat Singh

P.S. - Please write to me whenever you can. Your letters bring comfort not only to me but also give me news to share with Battu when I write to him.
