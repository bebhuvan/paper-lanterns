You desire to know whether Epicurus is right when, in one of his letters, he rebukes those who hold that the wise man is self-sufficient and for that reason does not stand in need of friendships. This is the objection raised by Epicurus against Stilpo and those who believe that the Supreme Good is a soul which is insensible to feeling.

We are bound to meet with a double meaning if we try to express the Greek term "lack of feeling" summarily, in a single Latin word, rendering it by the Latin word impatientia. For it may be understood in the meaning the Greeks intended, namely, "a soul which rejects any sensation of evil"; or it may be understood in the worse sense, meaning "a soul which can endure no hardship." Consider, therefore, whether it is not better to say "a soul that cannot be harmed," or "a soul entirely beyond the realm of suffering." There is this difference between ourselves and the other school: our ideal wise man feels his troubles, but overcomes them; their wise man does not even feel them.

But we and they alike hold this idea, that the wise man is self-sufficient. Nevertheless, he desires friends, neighbours, associates, no matter how much he is sufficient unto himself. And mark how self-sufficient he is; sometimes he is content with a part of himself. If he lose a hand through disease or war, or if some accident puts out one or both of his eyes, he will be satisfied with what is left, taking as much pleasure in his impaired and maimed body as he took when it was sound. But while he does not pine for these parts if they are missing, he prefers not to lose them.

In this sense the wise man is self-sufficient, that he can do without friends, not that he desires to do without them. When I speak of his being able to do without friends, I mean this: he endures the loss of a friend with equanimity.

But he need never lack friends, for it lies in his own control how soon he shall make good a loss. Just as Phidias, if he lose a statue, can straightway carve another, so our master in the art of making friendships can fill the place of a friend he has lost.

If you ask how one can make oneself a friend quickly, I will tell you, provided we are agreed that I may pay my debt at once and square the account, so far as this letter is concerned. Hecato, says: "I can show you a philtre, compounded without drugs, herbs, or any witch's incantation: 'If you would be loved, love.'"

Now there is great pleasure, not only in maintaining old friendships, but also in beginning and acquiring new ones. There is the same difference between gaining a new friend and having already gained him, as there is between the farmer who sows and the farmer who reaps. The philosopher Attalus used to say: "It is more pleasant to make than to keep a friend, as it is more pleasant to the artist to paint than to have finished painting." When the artist is laying on the colours, and when his hand is moving the brush, he derives enjoyment from his very work; but after the work is done, the pleasure is not so keen. Henceforth it is the fruits of his art, and not art itself, that he enjoys. In the case of our children, their young manhood yields the more abundant fruits, but their infancy was sweeter.

Let us examine the matter in another way. The wise man is self-sufficient. This phrase, my dear Lucilius, is incorrectly explained by many; for they withdraw the wise man from the world, and force him to depend upon himself. But we must mark the meaning of this phrase and how far it extends. The wise man is sufficient unto himself for a happy life, but not for mere existence. For he needs many helps towards mere existence; but for a happy life his own virtue suffices.

Virtue is free, inviolable, unmoved, unshaken, so steeled against the blows of chance that she cannot be bent, much less broken. Facing the instruments of torture she holds her gaze unflinching, her expression changes not a whit, whether a hard or a happy lot is shown her. Therefore, the wise man is self-sufficient.

And yet he wishes to have friends, if only for the purpose of practising friendship, in order that his noble qualities may not lie dormant. Not, however, for the purpose mentioned by Epicurus in the letter quoted above: "for someone to sit by him when he is ill, to help him when he is in prison or in want"; but that he may have someone by whose sick-bed he himself may sit, someone a prisoner in hostile hands whom he himself may set free.

He who regards himself only, and enters upon friendships for this reason, reckons wrongly. The end will be like the beginning: he has made friends who will assist him only as long as assistance is forthcoming.

Hence, also, you must ask me for that friendship which Socrates and Cato, Laelius and Scipio, shared with their friends. If we are agreed on this point, if we may speak frankly and tell each other the truth, then you may count on me.

Farewell.
