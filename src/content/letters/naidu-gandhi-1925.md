My dear Bapu,

Your letter asking about my views on women's participation in our satyagraha movement reaches me at a moment when I have been deeply reflecting on the profound connection between the freedom of women and the freedom of our motherland. I write to share with you thoughts that have been crystallizing through years of struggle, observation, and the countless conversations with women across India who hunger for both personal and national liberation.

The freedom of women is not separate from the freedom of India - they are two golden branches of the same tree of liberation. How can we speak of swaraj for our nation while half our population remains in the chains of social convention, economic dependence, and political invisibility? How can we build a free India on the foundation of unfree women?

I have traveled from the villages of Bengal to the princely states of Rajputana, from the cotton mills of Bombay to the tea gardens of Assam, and everywhere I see the same truth: women possess an untapped reservoir of strength, wisdom, and moral courage that our movement desperately needs. Yet we have barely begun to recognize, much less harness, this tremendous force for national regeneration.

Watch our women during hartals and boycott campaigns - they are often more determined than men in giving up foreign cloth, more creative in developing indigenous alternatives, more willing to make personal sacrifices for the collective good. The spinning wheel finds its most devoted disciples among women who understand intimately the connection between economic independence and personal dignity.

But we must go beyond asking women merely to support our struggle; we must invite them to lead it. Women's perspectives on social justice, their understanding of community welfare, their natural inclination toward non-violent resistance - these are not auxiliary contributions to our movement but essential elements that will determine its ultimate character.

I have observed that women approach politics differently than men. Where men often see politics as competition for power, women tend to see it as service to community. Where men may be satisfied with changing laws, women insist on changing hearts. Where men might accept formal equality, women demand substantive transformation of social relationships.

This feminine approach to public life is not weakness but strength - it is exactly what our future free India will need. We are not fighting merely to replace British rulers with Indian rulers; we are fighting to create a society based on justice, compassion, and the recognition of every individual's inherent dignity. Women's full participation is essential to achieving this vision.

Yet I must speak honestly about the obstacles we face, even within our own movement. Many of our male colleagues, while supporting women's education and social reform in abstract terms, remain uncomfortable with women's direct participation in political leadership. They praise women's moral influence while restricting their practical authority.

Even more troubling, some women have internalized these limitations, believing themselves unfit for public roles, accepting second-class status as natural rather than imposed. We must address this internal colonization of women's minds alongside our struggle against external colonization by the British.

The path forward requires simultaneous action on multiple fronts. We must continue challenging discriminatory laws and social practices that restrict women's opportunities. We must expand educational access so that every girl can develop her full intellectual potential. We must create economic opportunities that allow women to achieve financial independence.

But most importantly, we must transform our conception of what it means to be a woman in Indian society. The ideal of womanhood cannot remain confined to self-sacrifice and silent suffering. We must celebrate women who speak truth to power, who organize communities for change, who refuse to accept injustice as their fate.

I am encouraged by the young women joining our movement - educated, articulate, unafraid to challenge authority. They represent a generation that will not be content with the limited roles their mothers accepted. They will demand equal participation in building the India of tomorrow.

This generational change is already manifesting in remarkable ways. Women are forming their own political organizations, publishing newspapers and magazines, establishing schools and social service institutions, entering professions previously reserved for men. They are proving daily that competence and leadership ability know no gender boundaries.

But we cannot wait for gradual social evolution. The urgency of our national situation demands immediate recognition of women's equal citizenship. Every day we postpone full inclusion of women in our movement is a day we weaken our collective power against colonial oppression.

I propose that we make women's equality an explicit goal of our independence struggle, not an afterthought to be addressed later. Our vision of swaraj must include gender equality as a fundamental principle, not merely as a social reform to be considered once political freedom is achieved.

This means women's participation in all levels of decision-making within Congress and other nationalist organizations. It means women candidates for elected offices whenever such opportunities arise. It means women's voices in formulating policies that will shape our future nation.

It also means recognizing that women's issues are not special interests separate from national concerns - they are central to the kind of society we hope to create. Questions of education, health care, economic opportunity, legal rights, and social justice affect women particularly intensely but ultimately determine the character of our entire civilization.

The international women's suffrage movement offers both inspiration and cautionary lessons. We can learn from the strategies that have succeeded in other countries while avoiding the mistakes of movements that became isolated from broader social concerns. Our women's liberation must remain connected to our anti-colonial struggle and our vision of comprehensive social transformation.

I envision an independent India where women serve as ministers, judges, educators, scientists, artists, and business leaders alongside their roles as wives and mothers. I envision villages where women participate equally in community governance and urban areas where women's economic contributions are fully recognized and rewarded.

This is not about abandoning Indian traditions but about distinguishing between eternal spiritual values and temporary social arrangements. The reverence for feminine divinity in our religious heritage, the celebration of women's wisdom in our ancient texts, the examples of powerful queens and learned women in our history - these suggest that gender equality is not foreign to Indian culture but has been suppressed by centuries of external domination and internal ossification.

Our freedom struggle offers a unique opportunity to reclaim these liberating aspects of our tradition while discarding the restrictions that historical circumstances imposed. We can create a modern India that honors both ancient wisdom and contemporary justice.

Bapu, I know that you have always supported women's dignity and rights, even when other leaders remained silent. Your own experiments in community living have demonstrated the possibility of more egalitarian relationships between men and women. I ask now that you help make women's equality an explicit and prominent feature of our movement's message.

When we speak to crowds about swaraj, let us speak about women's swaraj as an integral component. When we organize civil disobedience, let us ensure that women participate as leaders, not merely as followers. When we imagine the India we hope to create, let us make clear that it will be a nation where gender creates no barriers to human fulfillment.

The world is watching our struggle with great interest. If we succeed in combining national liberation with women's liberation, we will provide a model that could inspire oppressed peoples everywhere. If we fail to include women as equal partners, we will have achieved only partial freedom.

I believe that Indian women, once fully awakened to their potential and given genuine opportunities for leadership, will contribute uniquely to solving the problems that will face our independent nation. Their perspectives on education, health care, social welfare, and conflict resolution may prove essential to building the just and prosperous society we all desire.

The golden branch of women's freedom must grow strong alongside the golden branch of national freedom, for together they form the tree under which future generations will find shelter, sustenance, and inspiration for their own struggles toward ever greater justice and human dignity.

Your devoted comrade in the fight for comprehensive freedom,

Sarojini

P.S. - I am organizing a women's conference next month to discuss these themes more fully with female leaders from across India. Your blessing for this gathering would mean much to those who still doubt that women's political activism has your support.
