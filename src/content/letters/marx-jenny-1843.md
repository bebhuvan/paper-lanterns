My darling, darling angel, what a place you have in my heart! When I am apart from you, I feel like a schoolboy who has lost his way. The mere thought of you sets my pulse racing and fills me with such yearning that I can hardly concentrate on my work.

You know, my dear Jenny, that I would gladly sacrifice everything—my career, my ambitions, everything on earth—for you. You are my life, my happiness, my everything. Without you, I am nothing but a restless spirit wandering through an empty world.

I think of you constantly. When I wake in the morning, your face is the first image in my mind. When I retire at night, it is your voice I long to hear whispering good night. During the day, every thought, every word I write, every idea that comes to me is somehow connected to you.

How you have changed me, my beloved! Before I knew you, I was consumed only with ideas, with theories, with the cold logic of philosophy. But you have taught me that the heart has its own wisdom, that love is not weakness but the greatest strength a man can possess.

I am impatient to see you again, to hold you in my arms, to look into those beautiful eyes that have become my guiding stars. Until that blessed moment, I remain your devoted husband, counting the hours until we are reunited.

Your faithful and loving Karl
