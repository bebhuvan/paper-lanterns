I had a terror since September—I could tell to none—and so I sing, as the Boy does by the Burying Ground—because I am afraid. You ask of my Companions Hills—Sir—and the Sundown—and a Dog—large as myself, that my Father bought me.

Mr. Higginson, you asked me to tell you what I am afraid of—I whisper it—I am afraid I am a nobody. When I read your essay about young contributors, I felt you might be one who could tell me if my thoughts breathe—or if they are just the gasps of a dying mind.

I cannot tell if what I write has any worth. I live here so quietly—the loudest thing in my world is the ticking of the clock in Father's study, or Austin's voice calling from next door, or the sound of my own pen scratching across this paper in the stillness of my room.

But inside me—oh, inside me there is such commotion! Thoughts that arrive like unexpected visitors, forcing me to drop everything and attend to them. Images that won't leave me alone until I've captured them in words, though the words always feel too small, too earthbound for the vastness they're trying to contain.

You ask about my companions. I told you of the Hills and Sundown because they are more faithful than any human friend. They never leave me, never change their essential nature, never demand explanations for my peculiarities. The Hills have watched me from my window for thirty years, and the Sundown visits every evening without fail.

I make no visits—I have not left Father's ground for months now. The world seems too much, too crowded with other people's certainties. Here in my white dress, in my quiet rooms, I can listen to the voices that matter most—the voice of the cricket, the voice of the grave, the voice of possibility that speaks when everything else falls silent.

I enclose four poems. I did not seek publication—I sought understanding. Could you tell me if they live? I would not want to breathe where bodies do—but if what I've written has any pulse of life, any authentic heartbeat, perhaps the terror that grips me since September might loosen its hold.

The terror is this: that I am becoming invisible even to myself, that my thoughts, however intense they feel to me, might be mere vapor, signifying nothing. In my poems I try to distill the enormous pressure of being alive into something clear and true.

I think I was enchanted—when I was little—and never disenchanted. The world still pulses with mystery for me. Every flower is a small sermon, every storm a great drama, every death a door opening onto the infinite.
