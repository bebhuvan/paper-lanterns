The little things are infinitely the most important, my dear Caroline. A kind word, a gentle look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles.

I have been thinking much lately about the art of writing, and I find myself convinced that it is not the grand gestures or the sweeping emotions that make a story memorable, but rather the small, truthful observations of human nature.

In your own writing, my dear, I encourage you to pay attention to the way people really speak, not the way they ought to speak. Notice how Mrs. So-and-so always adjusts her shawl when she's about to say something disagreeable, or how young Mr. What's-his-name cannot look directly at a lady when he pays her a compliment.

These tiny details, these glimpses into the comedy and contradiction of human behavior—these are the treasures that will make your readers say, "Yes, that is exactly how it is!"

Do not be discouraged if your first attempts seem small or insignificant. I have learned that there is great power in the domestic sphere, great drama in the drawing room. The human heart is the same whether it beats in a palace or a cottage, and its mysteries are just as profound when contemplated over a cup of tea as when pondered beneath the stars.

Write what you know, dear Caroline, but also write what you observe. Be gentle with your characters, even when you must be severe with their follies. Remember that we are all, every one of us, ridiculous and noble by turns, and it is the author's privilege—and responsibility—to show both sides of human nature with equal clarity and compassion.

I have such faith in your abilities, my dear child. You have a keen eye and a kind heart—what more does a writer need?
