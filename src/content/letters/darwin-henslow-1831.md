My dear Henslow, I hope you will forgive me for troubling you with a letter so soon after my departure, but I cannot help writing to express how grateful I am for your recommendation of me for this position.

As I write this, the Beagle rocks gently at anchor, and I can hardly believe that in a few days we shall be bound for South America. The prospect fills me with such excitement that I can barely sleep. To think that I shall see lands that few naturalists have ever explored, collect specimens that may be entirely unknown to science!

Captain FitzRoy is a most capable commander, though I confess I find his temper somewhat unpredictable. The other gentlemen aboard seem agreeable enough, and the crew appears competent. My cabin is small but adequate, and I have arranged my books and equipment as best I can.

I have been reading Humboldt's Personal Narrative with renewed enthusiasm. His descriptions of the tropical forests of South America have inflamed my imagination. I dream of discovering new species, of finding fossils that might illuminate the history of life on our planet.

Already, just from our brief stops along the English coast, I have observed phenomena that intrigue me greatly. The variation in barnacle species from port to port, the way certain birds adapt their behavior to local conditions â€” these small observations hint at larger patterns that I hope this voyage will help me understand.

I promise to write regularly and to send specimens whenever possible. Who knows what wonders await us in the lands ahead?
