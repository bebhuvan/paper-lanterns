My Fellow Americans,

Yesterday I stood before you and took the oath of office at one of the darkest moments in our nation's history. Today I write to expand upon the message I delivered from the Capitol steps, to speak directly to your hearts and minds about the challenges we face together and the hope that must sustain us through these difficult days.

The only thing we have to fear is fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. I spoke these words yesterday, but I want you to understand their deeper meaning, for they represent the foundation upon which we must build our recovery.

Fear has stalked our land for too long. Fear of unemployment, fear of losing our homes, fear that our banks will fail, fear that our children will inherit a broken nation. This fear has become a contagion more devastating than any economic depression, for it robs us of the very courage we need to fight our way back to prosperity.

But I have seen something in my travels across this great nation that gives me unshakeable confidence in our future. In the faces of farmers in Iowa, workers in Detroit, teachers in Alabama, merchants in California - I have seen not defeat, but determination. Not despair, but a quiet resolve to endure whatever trials await us. The American spirit is not broken; it is merely testing its strength against adversity.

We must acknowledge honestly the scope of our challenges. Nearly thirteen million of our fellow citizens are unemployed. Banks have closed their doors from coast to coast. Factories stand idle while their workers struggle to feed their families. Farmers watch crops rot in fields while city dwellers go hungry. These are not statistics - they are human tragedies that demand immediate and sustained action.

Yet I refuse to accept that these conditions represent our permanent fate. America has faced dark hours before and emerged stronger. We survived the birth pangs of independence, the agony of civil war, the trials of westward expansion. Each crisis taught us that our strength lies not in avoiding difficulties but in facing them with unity, ingenuity, and unwavering faith in democratic ideals.

The federal government cannot solve all our problems, but it can and must provide leadership when leadership is needed most. We will act - swiftly, boldly, and with full accountability to the American people. The special session of Congress I have called will consider measures to stabilize our banking system, provide immediate relief to the unemployed, and begin the long work of economic reconstruction.

But government action alone cannot restore prosperity. We need every American to play their part in this great work of national renewal. Business leaders must resist the temptation to hoard capital and instead invest in the productive capacity that creates jobs. Workers must maintain the skills and work ethic that made America great. Communities must care for their most vulnerable members while working together to attract new opportunities.

Most importantly, we must restore confidence - confidence in our institutions, confidence in each other, confidence in the fundamental soundness of the American economy. This confidence cannot be manufactured by government decree or created by wishful thinking. It must be earned through honest acknowledgment of our problems, realistic plans for their solution, and visible progress toward recovery.

I want to speak particularly to those who have lost jobs, homes, or businesses during these troubled times. Your suffering is real, and your government has not forgotten you. We are designing programs that will provide immediate relief while preserving the dignity that comes from honest work. These will not be handouts but opportunities - chances to contribute your skills and energy to projects that benefit the entire nation.

The conservation work we envision will employ young men in reforesting our lands, preventing soil erosion, and building recreational facilities for future generations. Public works projects will put skilled craftsmen back to work constructing bridges, roads, schools, and hospitals that our communities desperately need. Agricultural programs will help farmers stabilize prices while ensuring adequate food supplies for our cities.

These efforts require sacrifice from all sectors of society. Those who have maintained their prosperity must accept higher taxes to fund relief programs. Business owners must cooperate with new regulations designed to prevent the speculation and fraud that contributed to our current crisis. Workers must sometimes accept lower wages temporarily while industries rebuild their capacity.

But let me be absolutely clear about one thing: we will not ask the American people to accept permanent reductions in their standard of living. The measures we implement are emergency responses to an emergency situation. Our goal is not merely to survive the depression but to emerge from it with a stronger, more stable economy that provides opportunity for all our citizens.

International cooperation will be essential to our recovery efforts. No nation can achieve prosperity while its trading partners remain mired in depression. We will work with other nations to stabilize currencies, reduce trade barriers, and coordinate policies that benefit working people everywhere. America's recovery must contribute to global recovery, just as global recovery will support continued American prosperity.

I have great faith in the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the American people. Throughout our history, periods of crisis have sparked innovations that eventually made us more productive and prosperous than before. The challenges we face today will undoubtedly inspire new technologies, new forms of organization, new solutions to old problems. We must embrace change while holding fast to the values that define us as a people.

Education will play a crucial role in our recovery and future growth. We must ensure that young Americans acquire the skills needed in a modernizing economy while maintaining the broad knowledge that enables democratic citizenship. The schools and universities that seem like luxuries during hard times are actually investments in the human capital that will drive tomorrow's prosperity.

Women are playing an increasingly important role in American economic life, and our recovery plans must acknowledge this reality. The skills and energy of all our citizens - regardless of gender - are needed if we are to rebuild our economy on a sound foundation. The artificial barriers that prevent capable people from contributing their talents serve no one's interests in times like these.

We must also acknowledge that recovery cannot mean simply returning to the conditions that existed before the crash. Some of the practices that created enormous paper profits also created the instabilities that led to collapse. Our new prosperity must be built on sounder foundations - real production rather than speculation, shared benefits rather than concentrated wealth, long-term thinking rather than short-term gain.

The banking reforms we will propose aim not to punish financial institutions but to restore the confidence that makes them effective. People must know that their deposits are safe, that loans will be made based on genuine need and ability to repay, that banks serve the real economy rather than existing for their own sake. These changes will ultimately benefit honest bankers as much as their customers.

Agriculture requires special attention because farmers feed the nation and provide raw materials for industry. The price collapses that have devastated rural communities affect everyone who eats food or wears clothing. We must find ways to match production with demand while ensuring that farmers receive fair compensation for their essential work. This may require difficult adjustments, but the alternative is continued chaos in one of our most vital sectors.

Labor relations must also evolve to meet current challenges. Workers deserve fair wages and safe working conditions, while employers need the flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions. Both sides must recognize that their ultimate interests align - both benefit when businesses are profitable enough to provide steady employment at decent wages. Cooperation rather than confrontation will serve everyone better in the long run.

The task ahead will test our national character in ways we have never experienced. There will be setbacks and disappointments along the path to recovery. Some of our initiatives will fail, requiring us to learn from mistakes and try different approaches. But if we maintain our unity of purpose and our faith in democratic institutions, there is no challenge we cannot overcome.

I close this letter with a personal pledge to you, my fellow Americans. I will devote every waking hour to the work of national recovery. I will surround myself with the ablest advisors regardless of their political affiliation. I will communicate honestly about both our progress and our setbacks. And I will never lose faith in the capacity of free people to solve their problems through democratic cooperation.

The road ahead is long and difficult, but it leads to a destination worthy of our struggles. Together we will build not just recovery but renewal - not just restoration but reform. The America that emerges from this crisis will be stronger, fairer, and more prosperous than the one that entered it.

Your President, committed to serving with all the strength and wisdom God grants me,

Franklin D. Roosevelt

P.S. - I ask every American to remember that we are not merely individuals struggling alone but members of a great national community. Your neighbor's success contributes to your own; your neighbor's failure diminishes us all. In these dark days, let us be the light that guides each other toward better times ahead.
