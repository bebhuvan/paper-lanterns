I was not tired physically, or no more tired than I usually was at the end of a working day. I was not old, although some people have an image of me as being old then. I was forty-two. No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in.

Dear Mr. Nixon, as I sit here this evening after being released on bond, I keep thinking about what happened on that bus today. People keep asking me why I didn't just give up my seat like we've always been expected to do. The truth is, I had reached a point where I simply could not take it anymore.

It wasn't planned, you know. When I got on that Cleveland Avenue bus after my long day at Montgomery Fair department store, I was just thinking about getting home to my husband Raymond and having some supper. I took a seat in the first row of the colored section, right behind where the white section ended.

Then more white passengers got on, and that bus driver—James F. Blake, the same one who had put me off a bus twelve years ago for not entering through the back door—he ordered our whole row to stand up and move back so one white man could sit down. The other colored passengers in my row complied, but I stayed in my seat.

When Blake asked me if I was going to stand up, I told him, "No, I don't think I should have to stand up." He told me he was going to call the police and have me arrested. I said, "You may do that."

I wasn't trying to cause trouble, Mr. Nixon. But I was tired—tired of the humiliation, tired of being treated like a second-class citizen in my own country, tired of having to step aside and bow my head just because of the color of my skin. I thought about Emmett Till, that fourteen-year-old boy who was murdered in Mississippi just three months ago for allegedly whistling at a white woman. I thought about all the daily indignities we suffer just to survive in this segregated South.

When those policemen came on the bus, they asked me why I didn't stand up. I asked them, "Why do you push us around?" One of them said, "I don't know, but the law is the law, and you're under arrest." They took me off that bus and to the city jail, where they booked me for violating the city's racial segregation ordinances.

I know you and the other leaders have been looking for the right case, the right person to challenge these bus segregation laws in court. I want you to know that I'm ready to fight this. I may be just a seamstress, but I've been secretary of our NAACP chapter for over ten years. I know what's at stake here.

This isn't just about bus seats, Mr. Nixon. This is about human dignity. This is about whether colored people are going to continue to accept being treated as less than human, or whether we're finally going to stand up—or in my case, sit down—for our rights.

I've been thinking about my mother and my grandmother, who taught me that I should not feel inferior to anyone because of my race. They taught me to respect myself and to demand respect from others. Today on that bus, I was thinking about them, and I knew I couldn't dishonor their memory by giving in to injustice one more time.

I know there will be consequences for what I did today. I'll probably lose my job. Raymond and I might face threats and harassment. But I also know that change doesn't come easy, and somebody has to be willing to pay the price. If my arrest can be the spark that lights a fire under our community to finally say "enough is enough," then whatever happens to me will be worth it.

I'm ready to go to court, Mr. Nixon. I'm ready to challenge this law. And if you and Dr. King and the other ministers think a bus boycott might work, you have my full support. It's time for Montgomery's colored citizens to show that we won't ride in humiliation anymore.

The time for giving in is over. The time for standing up—even while sitting down—has come.
