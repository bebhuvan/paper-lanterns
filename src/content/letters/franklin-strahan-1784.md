My Dear Friend,

You and I were long friends; you are now my enemy, and I am yours. But let me tell you that I consider your present political conduct as the only error of a sensible man, and I still regard you with the same friendly feelings I ever had.

The war is over, and we are again friends. At least, I hope we are, and that our former harmony may be renewed. Your talents and your good heart are well known to me, and I believe that if we were to meet, we should find ourselves, in a quarter of an hour, as good friends as ever.

Let us forget our political differences. They arose from the circumstances of the times, and now that those circumstances have changed, let our friendship be renewed. I have always been convinced that the interests of Britain and America are the same, and that a cordial reconciliation would be beneficial to both.

I am now an old man, and I have seen enough of the world to know that friendship is more valuable than political victory. Life is too short to spend it in resentment and hostility when forgiveness and understanding are possible.

I hope this letter finds you in good health and that your business prospers. As for myself, I am well enough for my age, and I continue to enjoy the friendship of good men like yourself—when politics do not divide us.
