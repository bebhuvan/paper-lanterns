I paint my own reality. The only thing I know is that I paint because I need to, and I paint whatever passes through my head without any other consideration. I paint because I am broken, and painting makes me whole.

Mi querido Diego, as I write this letter from our bed where I spend so many hours now, confined by this body that betrays me at every turn, I think about the difference between your art and mine. Your murals speak to the masses, tell the grand story of Mexico, our revolution, our people's struggle. My paintings speak from the wound, from the place where the personal becomes universal.

You have accused me of being too focused on myself, too absorbed in my own pain. But what else can I paint, my love, except what I know most intimately? This spine that was shattered when I was eighteen, these surgeries that never seem to heal, this womb that cannot carry our children to term—this is my landscape, my geography of suffering.

But it is also my geography of defiance. When the doctors tell me I may never walk again, I paint myself standing. When they say I cannot bear children, I paint myself giving birth to dreams. When you betray me with other women, I paint myself whole and fierce, with roots growing from my wounds.

The Surrealists want to claim me, to say that I paint from my unconscious. What fools! I paint my conscious reality, the Mexico that runs through my veins, the pain that inhabits my bones, the love that consumes me even as it destroys me. There is nothing unconscious about a spine held together with steel rods or the heartbreak of losing another pregnancy.

You paint revolution on public walls; I paint revolution in the privacy of my own flesh. You show the workers rising up; I show a woman refusing to disappear, refusing to be silenced by pain or betrayal or a society that would rather she stay quiet and pretty and grateful for whatever scraps of attention she receives.

I paint because painting is the only place where I am truly sovereign. On my canvases, I am not the crippled wife of the famous muralist. I am not the woman who cannot have children, who cannot dance, who spends months in hospitals. On my canvases, I am Frida—complete, powerful, unapologetic.

My self-portraits are not vanity, Diego, though I know you sometimes think so. They are acts of survival. Each time I paint myself, I am saying: I exist. I matter. My pain has meaning. My joy has value. My Mexican blood, my indigenous heritage, my woman's body—all of this is worthy of art.

When I paint my miscarriages, I am not being morbid. I am refusing to let these losses disappear into silence. When I paint my operations, I am not seeking pity. I am transforming medical trauma into artistic triumph. When I paint our fights, our reconciliations, the way you hurt me and heal me in equal measure, I am writing our love story in colors that will outlast both our bodies.

You create for the future, my love. I create from the eternal now of this moment, this breath, this brushstroke. Both are necessary. Both are revolution.

Promise me, Diego, that when I am gone—and we both know this body cannot last much longer—promise me that you will remember not just the pain but the power. Not just the woman who suffered but the woman who refused to let suffering have the last word.

I am not broken, despite what my body tells you. I am a mosaic, and every crack lets in the light.
