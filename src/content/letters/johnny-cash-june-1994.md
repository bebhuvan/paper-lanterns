The spirit of June Carter breathes when you breathe, June. You're still my girl, and you're still the one I want to take in my arms and tell all my troubles to.

You're still the girl that can make me happy with a look, make me go to any lengths to hear you laugh. You're still the one I love to touch and kiss and hold. You're the one I want to share my secrets with, the one I want to share my life with.

You saved my life, you know. When I was in the dark, you were my light. When I was afraid, you were my courage. When I thought I was lost, you were my way home.

I love you more today than I did when I first said 'I love you' to you. I love you more today than I did yesterday, and I'll love you more tomorrow than I do today. That's the way it will always be with us, June.

We've walked through fire together, you and I. We've weathered every storm that came our way. And here we are, still standing, still loving, still believing in each other.

I want you to know that every day with you has been a blessing. Every laugh, every tear, every quiet moment â€” they've all been precious to me. You've made me a better man, June. You've made my life worth living.
