about:
  context: "Written just one week after his famous 'Negative Capability' letter, this letter continues Keats's exploration of aesthetic theory. He discusses Benjamin West's painting 'Death on a Pale Horse' and develops his ideas about intensity and beauty in art."
  significance: "This letter further develops Keats's aesthetic philosophy, particularly his concept of 'intensity' in art and poetry. His criticism of West's painting reveals his belief that great art must engage the viewer emotionally and sensually, not just intellectually."
  author_bio: "John Keats (1795-1821) was an English Romantic poet whose work was largely unrecognized during his lifetime but is now considered among the greatest in English literature. He died of tuberculosis at age 25, leaving behind some of the most beautiful poetry in the English language."
  recipient_info: "George Keats (1797-1841) and Tom Keats (1799-1818) were John's younger brothers. George emigrated to America, while Tom died young of tuberculosis. John maintained close correspondence with both throughout his short life."

My dear Brothers,

I spent Friday evening with Wells & went the next morning to see Death on the Pale horse. It is a wonderful picture, when West's age is considered; But there is nothing to be intense upon; no women one feels mad to kiss; no face swelling into reality. The excellence of every Art is its intensity, capable of making all disagreeables evaporate, from their being in close relationship with Beauty & Truth—Examine King Lear & you will find this exemplified throughout; but in this picture we have unpleasantness without any momentous depth of speculation excited, in which to bury its repulsiveness.

The picture is larger than Christ rejected—I dined with Haydon the sunday after you left, & had a very pleasant day, I dined too (for I have been out too much lately) with Horace Smith & met his two Brothers with Hill & Kingston & one Du Bois, they only served to convince me, how superior humour is to wit in respect to enjoyment—These men say things which make one start, without making one feel, they are all alike; their mannerisms are alike; they all know fashionables; they have a mannerism in their very eating & drinking, in their mere handling a Decanter—They talked of Kean & his low company—Would I were with that company instead of yours said I to myself! I know such like acquaintance will never do for me & yet I am going to Reynolds, on wednesday—Brown & Dilke walked with me & back from the Christmas pantomime. I had not a dispute but a disquisition with Dilke, on various subjects; several things dovetailed in my mind, & at once it struck me, what quality went to form a Man of Achievement especially in Literature & which Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is when man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason—Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half knowledge. This pursued through Volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.

Shelley's poem is out & there are words about its being objected too, as much as Queen Mab was. Poor Shelley I think he has his Quota of good qualities, in sooth la!! Write soon to your most sincere friend & affectionate Brother

John
