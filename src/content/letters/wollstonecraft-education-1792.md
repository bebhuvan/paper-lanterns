Dear Mrs. Macaulay,

Your recent encouragement has emboldened me to set down thoughts that have long occupied my mind regarding the education of my sex. I write not as a member of society, but as an individual reasoning being, claiming for my sex that improvement of mind which can alone render us capable of fulfilling our duties as rational creatures.

The present system of female education is fundamentally flawed. We teach girls to be ornamental rather than useful, to please rather than to think. Is it any wonder then that they appear inferior in understanding when they have been systematically denied the cultivation of their rational faculties?

I am convinced that the apparent superiority of man is not natural but artificial - the result of education and circumstance rather than divine decree. Give women the same advantages, the same encouragement to develop their minds, and I believe we shall find them equally capable of virtue, wisdom, and achievement.

We speak much of the rights of man in these revolutionary times, yet we deny half of humanity their most fundamental right - the right to the improvement of their understanding. How can a nation truly prosper when it wastes the talents of half its citizens?

My aim is not to make women masculine, but to make them rational beings capable of independent thought and moral judgment. A woman who can reason clearly will be a better mother, a more faithful wife, and a more valuable member of society than one trained only in superficial accomplishments.

I hope to publish these thoughts soon, though I fear they will be met with ridicule by those who profit from women's ignorance. Yet truth must be spoken, whatever the consequences.

Your devoted friend in the cause of truth,
Mary Wollstonecraft
