My esteemed colleague Kepler,

I have discovered four new worlds orbiting Jupiter, invisible to the naked eye but revealed through my optical tube. These celestial bodies complete their revolutions in prescribed times, some faster, some slower, according to their distances from Jupiter.

On the seventh day of January in this present year 1610, at the first hour of night, when I was viewing the heavenly bodies with a telescope, Jupiter presented itself to my attention. I noticed three small stars near it, fine and very bright. Though I believed them to be among the host of fixed stars, they aroused my curiosity.

When on January 8th I returned to the same investigation, I found a very different arrangement. The three small stars were now all to the west of Jupiter, closer together than the night before.

I had now decided beyond all question that there existed in the heavens three stars wandering about Jupiter as do Venus and Mercury about the Sun. This became plainer than daylight from observations on subsequent nights.

On the tenth of January, however, the stars appeared in this position with regard to Jupiter: only two stars were visible, the third being hidden by Jupiter. On the eleventh there were again three visible, but the third was larger than before.

I therefore concluded, and decided unhesitatingly, that there are three stars in the heavens moving about Jupiter, as Venus and Mercury round the Sun, which fact was apparently unknown by anyone before me.
