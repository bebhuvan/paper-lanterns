It would be a beautiful thing, a thing I dare not hope, if we could spend our life near each other, hypnotized by our dreams: your patriotic dream, our humanitarian dream, and our scientific dream.

Our conversation very soon became friendly. It seemed to me that I had found a brother, someone who understood my aspirations and could guide me in my work. I was entirely absorbed by the joy of the new comradeship.

I could not forget the conversation we had together; it would be such a wonderful thing if you could make a permanent place for me in your work. I know that my dream is a very bold one, but I cannot help hoping that you will not consider it entirely impossible.

I am among those who think that science has great beauty. A scientist in his laboratory is not only a technician: he is also a child faced with natural phenomena which impress him like a fairy tale.

We must have perseverance and, above all, confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something, and that this thing, at whatever cost, must be attained.
