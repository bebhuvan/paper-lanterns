My dearest Cassandra,

I have got my own darling child from London - and I find her as handsome as ever. Miss Austen, or rather Mrs. Darcy as she now appears in print, has been received quite well by those who have read her. I must confess that I think her as handsome as ever, though perhaps the work is rather too light & bright & sparkling; it wants shade; it wants to be stretched out here & there with a long Chapter - of sense if it could be had, if not of solemn specious nonsense - about something unconnected with the story; an Essay on Writing, a critique on Walter Scott, or the history of Bonaparte - or anything that would form a contrast & bring the reader with increased delight to the playfulness & Epigrammatism of the general stile.

The Publishers seem pleased enough with their bargain, though I suspect they have no notion of the true worth of what they have purchased. One hundred and ten pounds seems a trifling sum for what I consider my best work to date, but it is more than I received for Sense & Sensibility, so I must not complain.

I own myself quite anxious to know how the book is received generally. Have you heard any opinions expressed? I fancy I can be nothing but pleased with any praise, however modest, and I trust I can bear criticism with equal composure. The few who have read it speak well of it, but one always suspects the kindness of friends.

Mother continues well, and joins me in hoping your cold is quite recovered. I have been writing again - another story quite different from this one, which I think you will find more serious in tone. But perhaps my Elizabeth Bennet will find favor enough to justify another venture into print.

Write soon and tell me all the news from Godmersham.

Yours affectionately,
Jane
