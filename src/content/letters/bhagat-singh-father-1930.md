My dear Father,

I am astounded to learn that you have filed a petition to defend me in the Lahore Conspiracy Case. This is something I never expected from you.

You know very well what our views are regarding such matters. We believe that a political worker should boldly bear the heaviest possible sentence inflicted upon him for his principles and ideals. It is my principle to cheerfully accept whatever sentence is awarded to me. To file a petition for mercy or to present a defense would be a betrayal of our movement.

I am surprised that you, who have yourself suffered for the cause and spent years in jail, would think of weakening our position by such an action. This petition goes against everything we stand for.

I have already made it clear through my statements in court that I do not wish to defend this case. I am prepared to face whatever consequences my actions may bring. This is not bravado or false pride, but a matter of principle.

Our movement is based on sacrifice and suffering for the motherland. If we start seeking mercy or trying to escape the consequences of our actions, what message does that send to other revolutionaries? What example are we setting for the youth of our country?

I request you, with all the respect and love I have for you, to please withdraw this petition immediately. Do not weaken our cause by showing that we are afraid of death or punishment.

I am writing this letter with a heavy heart because I know it will pain you. But I cannot compromise on my principles, not even for the love I bear you. I hope you will understand my position and respect my decision.

If you truly love me and wish to honor my sacrifice, please let me face my destiny with dignity and courage. Do not rob me of the opportunity to prove that revolutionaries can die cheerfully for their cause.

I am in good health and high spirits. I am not afraid of death, and I do not want anyone to be afraid on my behalf. My only concern is that our movement should not be weakened by any show of weakness on our part.

Please convey my love to mother and other family members. Tell them not to worry about me. I am at peace with my conscience and ready to face whatever comes.

I also request that you make this letter public so that people may know the true position and understand why I refuse to defend myself in this case.

Your son,
Bhagat Singh

P.S. - Remember, father, that the seed of martyrdom, once sown, bears fruit in its own season. Let me water it with my blood so that the tree of freedom may grow strong.
