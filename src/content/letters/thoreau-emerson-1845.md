My dear Emerson,

I went to the woods to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.

It has been two months now since I took up residence in my small cabin by Walden Pond, and I write to share with you some observations from this experiment in simple living. The morning mist rises from the pond as I write these words, and I am struck daily by how much of life's richness we miss in our hurried pursuit of what we imagine to be necessities.

I have found that a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone. Here, with only the most basic furnishings - a bed, a desk, three chairs ("one for solitude, two for friendship, three for society") - I discover that I want for nothing essential. The luxury of having time to observe the changing light on water, to listen to the varied songs of birds, to think without interruption - these are riches that no amount of accumulated possessions could provide.

The pond teaches me daily lessons. In its depths I see reflected not just the sky and surrounding trees, but something of the infinite. It is a mirror of heaven, and in its seasonal changes I read the great book of nature that you have so often encouraged me to study.

I have been hoeing beans - seven miles of rows! - and in this simple labor I find a meditation. Each morning I go forth to battle with weeds, and in this humble contest I learn something about persistence, about the patient work required to cultivate anything worthwhile, whether beans or thoughts or character.

The visitors who come to my cabin often ask if I am not lonely. But I have found that I am never less alone than when alone. In solitude, I discover not isolation but connection - to the natural world, to my own thoughts, to the great currents of life that flow through all things.

I am learning to distinguish between what I want and what I need, between the voice of society and the voice of my own conscience. In the woods, away from the noise of commerce and convention, I can hear more clearly the still small voice within that speaks of what is truly important.

This is not a retreat from life, but an advance toward it. I am not running away from the world, but running toward a truer understanding of what the world might be if we lived more deliberately, more consciously, more in harmony with the natural rhythms that surround us.

I hope to continue this experiment for at least two years, to experience all seasons in this place, to learn what Walden Pond has to teach about the art of living. Already I sense that this time will change me in ways I cannot yet fully comprehend.

Your friend,
Henry
