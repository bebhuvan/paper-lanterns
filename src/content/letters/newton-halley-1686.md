  context: "This letter was written during the period when Newton was developing his Principia Mathematica, responding to Halley's inquiries about planetary motion. Halley had visited Newton in 1684 asking about the curve traced by planets under an inverse square force law."
  significance: "This correspondence led directly to Newton's Principia Mathematica (1687), one of the most important scientific works ever written. It established the mathematical foundation for understanding planetary motion and universal gravitation."
  author_bio: "Isaac Newton (1643-1727) was an English polymath who made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics, physics, and astronomy. His laws of motion and universal gravitation dominated scientific thinking for over 200 years and laid the foundation for classical mechanics."

My Dear Halley,

I have at length found that the centripetal force which keeps the planets in their orbits must be reciprocally as the square of their distances from the centres about which they revolve. This I have demonstrated from Kepler's rule of the sesquialterate proportion of the periodic times to the mean distances of the planets from the sun.

The demonstration is as follows: If we suppose the periodic times of the planets to be as the 3/2 power of their mean distances from the sun (which is Kepler's third law), and if we further suppose that the planets move in circles, then by comparing the centripetal forces required to maintain circular motion, we find that these forces must be inversely proportional to the square of the distance.

For a planet moving in a circle of radius r with period T, the centripetal acceleration is 4π²r/T². Since T² ∝ r³ (by Kepler's law), we have T² = kr³ for some constant k. Therefore, the acceleration becomes 4π²r/(kr³) = (4π²/k)/r², which shows the inverse square relationship.

This same law applies not only to the planets about the sun, but to the satellites about their primary planets. The moon's motion about the earth follows this same principle, as do the satellites of Jupiter which you have so carefully observed.

I have further found that this inverse square law, combined with the principle of inertia, can account for all the observed motions of the celestial bodies, including the elliptical orbits described by Kepler. The mathematics, though intricate, reveals a beautiful simplicity in nature's design.

The implications extend beyond astronomy. I believe this same force that governs the heavens also operates here on earth - the force that causes an apple to fall is the very same that keeps the moon in its orbit, differing only in magnitude according to the inverse square law.

I am preparing a more complete treatment of these principles, which I hope will demonstrate that the system of the world operates according to mathematical laws that can be precisely determined and predicted.

Your encouragement in these investigations has been invaluable, and I look forward to sharing the full development of these ideas with you soon.

Is. Newton
