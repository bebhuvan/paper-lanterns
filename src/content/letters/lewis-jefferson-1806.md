Sir,

It is with pleasure that I announce to you the safe arrival of myself and party at 12 o'clock today at this place with our papers and baggage. In obedience to your orders we have penetrated the Continent of North America to the Pacific Ocean, and sufficiently explored the interior of the country to affirm with confidence that we have discovered the most practicable route which does exist across the continent by means of the navigable branches of the Missouri and Columbia Rivers.

Such is the report I have the honor to make to you of the success of the enterprise under my direction. We have had every reason to believe that we have fully accomplished the objects of the expedition. We have ascertained the most northern source of the Missouri, have passed the Rocky Mountains, and descended by the Columbia to the Pacific Ocean.

The route we have pursued is the one which appears to present the fewest obstacles to the passage across the continent; still the passage by land is 340 miles from the navigable part of the Missouri to the navigable part of the Columbia. The navigation of the Missouri may be deemed safe and good; its difficulties arise from its rapidity, its falling banks, sandbars, and timber.

We have brought with us several articles which we trust will prove interesting to the philosophical world: mineral specimens, plant specimens, the skins and skeletons of animals, and a pretty extensive collection of Indian vocabularies.

I have the honor to be with the most sincere and affectionate attachment, Your most obedient servant.
