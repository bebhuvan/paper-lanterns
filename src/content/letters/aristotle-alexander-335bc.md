My dear Alexander,

As you embark upon your great enterprise, I write to remind you of the principles we discussed during your education here in Mieza. Remember, my dear Alexander, that a king must be a philosopher in action, and a philosopher must understand the art of ruling men.

The greatest conquest is not of territories, but of oneself. Before you can rule others justly, you must first achieve mastery over your own passions and desires. The temperate ruler who governs himself will find that others willingly follow his leadership.

In your dealings with the peoples you encounter, remember that virtue is universal, though its expressions may differ among nations. The Persian may worship different gods than the Greek, but courage, justice, and wisdom are recognized by all civilized peoples. Seek to understand their customs before seeking to change them.

A wise ruler surrounds himself with advisors who will speak truth to power. Beware of flatterers who tell you only what they think you wish to hear. The greatest danger to a king is not external enemies, but the corruption that comes from unlimited power and constant praise.

Remember too that the purpose of government is the flourishing of its citizens. A state exists not for the glory of its ruler, but for the good life of its people. The happiness of the many must outweigh the ambitions of the few, even when that few includes the king himself.

As you encounter new cities and peoples, consider which of their institutions might be worthy of adoption. The wise ruler learns from all sources and adapts the best practices to his own circumstances. Cultural exchange enriches both conqueror and conquered.

Finally, my dear student, remember that all earthly glory is temporary. The empire you build will one day pass away, but the example you set and the principles you embody may influence generations yet unborn. Strive to be remembered not merely as Alexander the Conqueror, but as Alexander the Just.

May the gods grant you wisdom in your endeavors.

Your devoted teacher,
Aristotle
