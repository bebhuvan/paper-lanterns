Blessed old fellow, I was so glad to get your letter. I want you to feel that you have in you the making of a man, and I want you to be eager to develop what is best in you.

You know I have the utmost confidence in you, old man, and I know that you will come out all right. You have such a good heart and such a straight nature that I am not a bit worried about your getting along well with your companions and with your masters.

The thing I want you to remember is that it is of the utmost importance to form good habits of work. A lazy man is of no use, no matter how pleasant and good-natured he may be.

I want you always to remember that you must work hard in order to succeed, and that the success will be proportionate to the energy and intelligence you show in your work.

But don't think that work is inconsistent with enjoying yourself. If you work hard, then when you do play you will play all the harder, and your play will do you all the more good.
