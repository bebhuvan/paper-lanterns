In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart. I simply can't build up my hopes on a foundation consisting of confusion, misery, and death. I can feel the sufferings of millions and yet, if I look up into the heavens, I think that it will all come right.

Dear Kitty, it's been over two years since we went into hiding, and some days the walls of our Secret Annex feel like they're closing in around us. The news from outside grows more terrible each day—stories of deportations, concentration camps, and the systematic murder of our people. Yet somehow, in the midst of all this darkness, I find myself clinging to hope.

Perhaps that sounds naive to you, Kitty. Perhaps a girl who has seen her friends disappear one by one, who has had to abandon her normal life and live like a mouse in the walls, should be more bitter, more cynical about human nature. But I can't help myself—when I see Mr. Kugler and Mr. Kleiman risking their lives to bring us food and news, when I remember the kindness of Miep and Bep, I am reminded that goodness still exists in this world.

Yesterday we heard from the radio that thousands of Dutch Jews have been sent to the camps. I thought of my friend Lies, wondering if she's still alive, if she's warm, if she has enough to eat. The not-knowing is almost worse than knowing the worst. But then I remember her laughter, her silly jokes about boys, the way she shared her lunch with me at school, and I think: that goodness, that capacity for love and friendship—surely that can't be destroyed, even by the Nazis.

I've been reading so much during our time here, Kitty. Books about history, about philosophy, about the great questions that have always puzzled humanity. And what strikes me is that in every age, in every dark period of history, there have been people who chose compassion over cruelty, who risked everything to help strangers, who maintained their humanity even when surrounded by inhumanity.

Mother thinks I'm too optimistic, that I don't understand how bad things really are. But I do understand, Kitty. I understand that there are people out there who want to kill me simply because I was born Jewish. I understand that millions are dying because of hatred and prejudice. I understand that the world can be a cruel and senseless place.

But I also understand that for every person who chooses evil, there's another who chooses good. For every Nazi who murders innocent people, there's a Miep who risks her life to save them. For every collaborator who betrays his neighbors, there's a Jan who helps them escape. For every heart filled with hatred, there's another filled with love.

Sometimes at night, when I'm lying in my narrow bed listening to the sound of bombs falling on Amsterdam, I think about what I want to do after the war. I know that sounds presumptuous—who am I to assume I'll survive when so many others haven't? But I can't help dreaming about the future, about the books I want to write, about the family I might have, about the world we might rebuild from the ashes of this one.

I want to be a writer, Kitty. I want to tell the story not just of what we've endured, but of what we've learned. I want to write about the helper who never asked for anything in return, about the moments of laughter we've shared even in our darkest hours, about the way Peter and I found love in the most unlikely circumstances.

Because that's the thing about human beings—we adapt, we survive, we even flourish in the most impossible situations. We tell jokes when we should be crying, we fall in love when the world is falling apart, we dream of tomorrow when today seems hopeless.

Father says I'm still just a child, that I don't really understand the complexities of the world. But maybe that's my strength, Kitty. Maybe my childish faith in human goodness is exactly what the world needs more of. Maybe the adults have become too cynical, too willing to accept that things can't change.

I refuse to accept that hatred is stronger than love, that evil is more powerful than good, that this war represents the true nature of humanity. This war is an aberration, a sickness that will pass. The real nature of humanity is what I see in our helpers, in the love between my parents despite their arguments, in Margot's quiet strength, in my own stubborn refusal to give up hope.

When this war is over—and it will be over, Kitty, I believe that with all my heart—I want to work to make sure nothing like this ever happens again. I want to help build a world where being different isn't dangerous, where children can grow up without fear, where people are judged by their character rather than their race or religion.

Maybe that's too ambitious for one young girl. Maybe I'm dreaming impossible dreams. But without dreams, without hope, without the belief that people can change and grow and become better—what's the point of surviving at all?

So yes, in spite of everything—in spite of the fear, the hunger, the loneliness, the uncertainty—I still believe that people are really good at heart. I have to believe it, Kitty. It's the only thing that keeps me sane.
