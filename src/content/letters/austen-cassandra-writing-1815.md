My dearest Cassandra,

Your last letter made me laugh so heartily that I nearly choked on my morning chocolate! You suggest I should attempt a Gothic romance in the manner of Mrs. Radcliffe, complete with mysterious castles and swooning heroines. I might as well try to write a romance as you could, and we should both be equally ridiculous. Yet I find in the most ordinary drawing rooms material enough for a dozen novels.

Yesterday, at the Middletons' tea party, I witnessed such a perfect display of human folly that I could barely contain my amusement. Mrs. B— spent the entire afternoon attempting to convince everyone of her daughter's superior accomplishments, while the poor girl sat mute as a fish, clearly wishing herself anywhere else. Meanwhile, young Mr. F— preened about his recent inheritance, completely oblivious to the calculating looks he received from every mother with marriageable daughters.

This is what I love about writing - the way people reveal themselves so completely when they think no one is paying attention. I have learned to sit quietly in corners, embroidering or reading, while the most delicious conversations unfold around me. People assume a woman with a book is not listening, which makes me an excellent spy in my own drawing room.

I am convinced that three or four families in a country village provide exactly the material needed for a novel. Why should I invent exotic locations or improbable adventures when human nature, in all its contradictions, plays out so beautifully in everyday life? The way a woman arranges her shawl can tell you everything about her character. The topics a man chooses for conversation reveal his heart more clearly than any dramatic speech.

You ask about my current work. I am deep in the story of Emma Woodhouse, a young woman who fancies herself an expert at managing other people's lives while remaining blind to her own heart. She is, I confess, not entirely likeable - she is spoiled, presumptuous, and often wrong. Yet I find her fascinating because she is so recognizably human in her flaws.

The challenge is making readers care about someone who makes such poor choices. But isn't this more interesting than a perfect heroine? Real people are contradictory - capable of both kindness and cruelty, wisdom and foolishness, often within the same conversation. I want my characters to feel as real as our neighbors, complete with all their irritating habits.

I have been experimenting with what I call "free indirect discourse" - letting us see through a character's eyes without being trapped entirely in their perspective. It allows me to show Emma's thoughts while also revealing things she doesn't understand about herself. The reader becomes complicit in understanding more than the character does.

People often ask why I don't write about great events or exotic places. But I believe that how a person behaves at a dinner party tells us more about their character than how they might behave during a battle. Does he monopolize the conversation? Does she listen with genuine interest or merely wait for her turn to speak? These are the tests that matter in daily life.

I must admit, there are times when I worry that my small canvas makes me insignificant compared to the great poets and historians. But then I observe how much drama, comedy, and genuine emotion plays out in our little Hampshire village, and I think: here is the world entire, just on a smaller scale.

The art, I believe, lies not in choosing extraordinary subjects but in seeing the extraordinary within the ordinary. Every marriage proposal is a drama of hope and fear. Every social gathering is a complex dance of alliance and rivalry. Every family contains enough love, resentment, and misunderstanding to fuel a tragedy or comedy, depending on how you tell it.

I find I cannot write what I do not understand. This is why my heroes and heroines are always people I might meet in a country parish - not because I lack imagination, but because I trust my ability to observe and understand these characters completely. I know how they would respond to any situation because I have watched their real-life counterparts for years.

Your suggestion about writing a novel of sentiment made me smile. I fear I am too much amused by human absurdity to write anything entirely serious. Even when my characters suffer, I cannot resist showing the ridiculous aspects of their suffering. Perhaps this makes me heartless, but I find that laughter and compassion often spring from the same source - clear sight.

Give my love to our parents, and tell them that their youngest daughter continues her peculiar occupation of turning neighbors into fictional characters. At least it keeps me entertained during the long winter evenings!

Your affectionate sister,
Jane

P.S. - I have just heard that Mr. R— has proposed to Miss S— after only three meetings. If this isn't proof that real life provides all the improbability any novelist could require, I don't know what is!
