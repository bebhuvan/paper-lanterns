Brother, I have not lost heart nor fallen in spirit. Life is everywhere, life is in ourselves and not in the external. There will be people near me, and to be a human being among human beings, and remain one forever, no matter what misfortunes befall, not to become depressed, and not to falter—this is what life is, herein lies its task.

I have come to recognize this. This idea has entered into my flesh and blood. Yes, it's true! That head which created, lived the higher life of art, which acknowledged and had come to know the higher demands of the spirit, that head has been cut from my shoulders.

Memory and images remain, created but not yet incarnated by me. They will lacerate me, it is true! But there remains in me a heart and the same flesh and blood which can also love, and suffer, and desire, and remember, and this is, after all, life.

The sun shines, oh how bright, and the sky so blue! No brother, do not regret what you have lost. The main thing is health, the rest will follow. I hope that the hard times are passing. One must hope.

Now I am resurrected from the dead. And if there is no happiness for me in this life, if I must die without having expressed everything that burns in me, that's not important—I will die but my spirit, everything that is sacred and eternal in me, will not die.
