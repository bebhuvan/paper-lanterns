Dear Mr. President,

I write to you as an economist deeply concerned about the prolonged economic suffering affecting millions of Americans and people throughout the world. The traditional remedies prescribed by orthodox economic theory have clearly failed to address the magnitude of this crisis. I believe the time has come for bold governmental action based on a new understanding of how modern economies actually function.

The object of recovery is to increase the national income and put more men to work. In the economic field this is the primary aim of government. There is nothing in the nature of this problem which is intractable, if we approach it with the right intellectual framework and sufficient political will.

The fundamental error in current thinking is the belief that government finances should operate like those of a prudent household - that in times of economic distress, governments should reduce spending, balance budgets, and wait for natural market forces to restore prosperity. This approach, while superficially logical, ignores the essential difference between individual and aggregate behavior in economic systems.

When one household reduces its spending, this may improve that household's financial position. But when all households simultaneously reduce spending - as they naturally do during economic uncertainty - the result is reduced income for everyone. The shopkeeper sells less, so he buys less from his suppliers, who therefore employ fewer workers, who then have less to spend at shops. This vicious cycle of declining demand and employment can persist indefinitely without external intervention.

The same principle applies with even greater force to government policy. When governments reduce spending during recessions, they remove demand from the economy precisely when additional demand is most needed. The result is deeper unemployment, longer duration of economic distress, and ultimately larger budget deficits as reduced economic activity decreases tax revenues while increasing relief expenditures.

I propose instead that recovery requires a coordinated program of government investment designed to increase employment and restore confidence. This should focus on two main areas: direct public works expenditure and measures to encourage private investment through lower interest rates and improved business confidence.

Public works programs serve multiple purposes beyond their immediate employment effects. They create useful infrastructure that enhances long-term economic productivity. They demonstrate government commitment to recovery, thereby improving business and consumer confidence. Most importantly, they inject purchasing power into the economy, which circulates through multiple spending rounds, ultimately creating employment and income far beyond the initial government expenditure.

This "multiplier effect" is perhaps the most important concept for understanding how government spending can stimulate recovery. When the government employs a worker on a public project, that worker spends his wages on food, clothing, and housing. The merchants who sell these goods then have more income to spend, and their suppliers and employees likewise benefit. The total increase in national income and employment can be several times the original government expenditure.

Critics argue that such policies will create dangerous budget deficits and undermine fiscal responsibility. But this criticism fails to distinguish between different types of deficit spending. Borrowing to finance consumption during normal times may indeed be imprudent. But borrowing to finance productive investment during periods of involuntary unemployment serves the essential function of utilizing idle resources that would otherwise remain wasted.

Moreover, the fiscal arithmetic of depression economics differs fundamentally from normal period calculations. Government spending during recession not only provides direct benefits but also increases tax revenues by expanding economic activity. As employment and incomes recover, the burden of relief expenditures diminishes while tax collections improve. Many public investments eventually pay for themselves through enhanced economic productivity.

The liquidity trap that characterizes severe depressions creates additional complications that monetary policy alone cannot address. When interest rates approach zero and businesses and consumers remain reluctant to borrow despite cheap credit, traditional monetary stimulus becomes ineffective. Under these conditions, fiscal policy - direct government spending - becomes the essential tool for economic recovery.

I urge you to consider a comprehensive program with several components:

First, a substantial public works program focusing on infrastructure improvements that will benefit the economy for decades to come. Roads, bridges, schools, hospitals, and conservation projects can provide immediate employment while creating lasting value.

Second, direct relief programs that maintain purchasing power for the unemployed and their families. Relief payments are not merely humanitarian gestures but economic necessities that maintain demand for basic goods and services.

Third, financial system reforms that restore confidence in banking while ensuring adequate credit availability for sound business investments. The banking crisis has created a credit shortage that prevents even profitable enterprises from expanding employment.

Fourth, international economic cooperation to prevent the self-defeating policies of competitive devaluation and trade restrictions that have deepened the global depression. Recovery in America will be enhanced by recovery abroad, and vice versa.

Some will argue that such policies represent dangerous departures from sound economic principles. But the conventional principles have demonstrably failed to address current conditions. The classical economists assumed that economies naturally tend toward full employment, but we observe prolonged periods of mass unemployment. They assumed that saving automatically leads to investment, but we see idle savings coexisting with unused productive capacity.

The economy is not a self-regulating machine that automatically maintains optimal employment levels. It is a complex social system that can become trapped in low-level equilibrium, where rational individual behavior produces collectively irrational outcomes. Government intervention becomes necessary not to override market mechanisms but to restore the conditions under which those mechanisms can function effectively.

This approach requires abandoning the moralistic language that often surrounds economic policy discussions. Economic policy should be judged by its practical results in promoting human welfare, not by its adherence to abstract theoretical principles or conventional notions of fiscal virtue.

The human cost of continued depression far exceeds any risks associated with activist government policy. Prolonged unemployment destroys not only current production but also human skills, business relationships, and social cohesion. The longer recovery is delayed, the more difficult and expensive it becomes to restore full prosperity.

International experience provides encouraging evidence for the effectiveness of these approaches. Countries that have abandoned deflationary policies and pursued expansionary fiscal measures have generally experienced better recovery outcomes than those that have maintained orthodox approaches.

The choice facing America is not between government intervention and free markets, but between intelligent intervention and the continuation of policies that have already failed. The market economy's great strengths in allocating resources and incentivizing innovation can only be preserved by ensuring that it operates at reasonably full employment levels.

I am confident that bold action along these lines will demonstrate that democratic governments can effectively address economic crises without resorting to the authoritarian solutions that have tempted other nations facing similar challenges. The preservation of democratic institutions may well depend on our ability to prove that free societies can provide economic security for their citizens.

The technical obstacles to recovery are not insurmountable. What is required is the political courage to act on new understanding rather than remaining trapped by outdated economic doctrines. Future generations will judge us not by our adherence to conventional budget arithmetic but by our success in restoring prosperity and preserving democratic values during this critical period.

I hope these observations may be of some use as you consider the momentous policy decisions that lie ahead. The world watches with great hope as America grapples with these challenges, and success in your efforts will benefit not only your own citizens but all peoples struggling to maintain both prosperity and freedom.

Yours sincerely,

J. M. Keynes

P.S. - I should be happy to elaborate on any of these points if you believe more detailed discussion would be helpful. The theoretical framework I have outlined can be applied to specific policy proposals as circumstances require.
