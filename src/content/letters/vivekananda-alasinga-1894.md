My dear Alasinga,

Your letter has been received. I am very glad to hear from you, but sorry to learn that you are trying to imitate me. My ideal indeed can never be yours. You are you, I am I. You have to be Alasinga, I have to be Vivekananda.

Do you understand this? You have certain tendencies in your nature. You have to grow according to your own nature. Don't try to imitate me or anyone else. Imitation is the cause of all weakness. Each one must be original and work out his own salvation.

The same fire which cooks a meal burns down a house. Fire is not to blame. It is the same with our spiritual forces. The very forces which in the ignorant work as attachment, aversion, and delusion, in the knowing work as non-attachment, love, and wisdom.

You must have your own realization. Books and teachers can only help, but the work is yours and yours alone. No one can give you realization. You must work it out for yourself.

I want each one of my children to be a hundred times greater than I could ever be. Every one of you must be a giant - must, that is my word. Obedience to the Guru without questioning, and strict observance of Brahmacharya - this is the secret of success.

But remember, the Guru is not the body. The Guru is the teaching. If you can find the truth elsewhere, take it. Truth is nobody's property. Take the jewel wherever you find it.

Work, work, work - let this be your motto. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body be full of that idea of work, work. Under all circumstances work. Work and worship, worship and work - this is all the religion you need.

Your brother,
Vivekananda
