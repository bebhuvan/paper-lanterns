In this mountain village, listening to the sound of rain on bamboo leaves, I understand that the greatest poems are not written but lived. The haiku seeks not to capture beauty but to become transparent to it.

Dear Kyorai, your letter asking about the essence of haiku has found me in perfect solitude, surrounded by the changing colors of autumn. As I write, a single leaf falls past my window—neither rushing nor lingering, simply following the way of all leaves. In that moment of watching, I glimpsed what I have been trying to teach you about our art.

You worry too much about the rules—the seventeen syllables, the seasonal words, the cutting phrase. These are like the bamboo framework that supports a paper lantern. Important, yes, but not the light itself. The light is awareness, the sudden illumination that comes when the mind becomes still as a mountain lake.

Yesterday, walking the mountain path, I came upon an old pond. A frog leaped into the water—plop! In that instant, the eternal and the momentary became one. The sound of water, the ripples spreading outward, the return to stillness—this was not a subject for a poem but the poem itself, complete before any words could capture it.

*Old pond—*  
*a frog leaps in,*  
*the sound of water*

Do you see, dear friend? The haiku did not describe this moment; it became this moment. The reader does not learn about the pond; the reader enters the pond, hears the splash, feels the ripples in their own awareness.

This is what I mean when I say we must learn from nature. The cherry blossom does not try to be beautiful; it simply blooms according to its nature. The mountain stream does not compose music; it simply flows, and its flowing is the most perfect song. Our haiku must have this same naturalness, this same inevitability.

But how does one achieve such naturalness? Through practice, yes, but more importantly through emptying. The ego-mind wants to impress, to display cleverness, to force meaning. The haiku-mind wants nothing, expects nothing, simply receives what is given and offers it back with gratitude.

I think of my teacher, who told me: "Go to the pine if you want to learn about the pine. Do not take your own ideas to it." This is the secret of our way—complete receptivity, complete attention, complete surrender to the moment as it reveals itself.

You ask about the spiritual dimension of our practice. The Buddha taught that suffering comes from attachment, from the mind's constant grasping after permanence in a world of constant change. The haiku teaches us to love impermanence itself—the falling leaf, the melting snow, the last cricket of autumn.

When I write:

*This autumn evening—*  
*no longer able to forget*  
*the sound of insects*

I am not speaking of memory but of presence, of how the deepest experiences continue to resonate in consciousness like temple bells long after they are struck. The insects have ceased their singing, but their song lives on in the space between thoughts.

The Way of haiku is the Way of poverty—not material poverty necessarily, but poverty of spirit, the blessed emptiness that allows us to be filled moment by moment with the inexhaustible richness of ordinary experience. The master possesses nothing and therefore lacks nothing.

I have been walking the narrow path for many years now, and I begin to understand that every step is both journey and destination. The path does not lead somewhere else; the path is the somewhere else. Each haiku is both practice and fulfillment, both question and answer.

Continue your practice, dear Kyorai, but hold it lightly. Let each poem be a small death, a complete letting go, so that new life can enter. The bamboo bends in the wind not because it is weak but because it knows the secret of true strength—the strength that comes from yielding.

May your poems flow like water, rest like stones, and illuminate like the moon reflecting on still water.
