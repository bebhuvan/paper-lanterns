My dear Josephine,

Your letter reached me at a moment when I was feeling particularly tested by the criticisms and misunderstandings that seem to follow my lectures wherever I go. There are those who question my right to speak for India, others who challenge my understanding of Hindu philosophy, and still others who wonder at my devotion to my Master.

But I find that these trials only strengthen my resolve. I want to do things only because they are my Father's will. When I remember this—when I center myself in this truth—all the noise of controversy fades into insignificance.

The work of awakening India to her own greatness, of showing the West the profound spirituality of the East, of breaking down the barriers of prejudice and misunderstanding—this is not my work alone. It is the work He has given me, and I am merely the instrument through which His will flows.

I have been lecturing on the conditions of Indian women, trying to show American audiences the reality behind their preconceptions. It is difficult work, for I must constantly balance truth-telling with the need to inspire rather than merely criticize. I want them to see the nobility that exists even in the midst of current limitations, the potential that awaits awakening.

Sometimes I feel the loneliness of this path acutely. To be neither fully Eastern nor Western, to stand as a bridge between worlds—this requires a strength that I do not always feel I possess. But then I remember His words, His presence, and I know that I am never truly alone.

The plague work in Calcutta taught me much about real service. When I knelt beside those suffering souls, when I saw fear transform into gratitude, when I felt the walls between "self" and "other" dissolve—in those moments I understood what it truly means to be an instrument of the Divine.

I carry that understanding with me now as I speak to these American audiences. Each lecture is an act of service, each moment of connection across cultural barriers is a victory for His vision of universal brotherhood.

Pray for me, dear friend, that I may continue to be worthy of the work He has entrusted to me.

Your devoted sister in the Master,

Sister Nivedita
