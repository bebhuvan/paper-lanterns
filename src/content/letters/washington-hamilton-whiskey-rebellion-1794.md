My Dear Sir,

Your letter of the 19th came duly to hand. I shall be happy to see you here on Saturday, as proposed in yours of yesterday.

From the complexion which this insurrection has assumed, and from the declarations and conduct of the leaders of it, there can be no doubt in the mind of any unprejudiced person, that the object is to overturn the general government of this country, and to compel it to adopt such measures as would be destructive to the peace, happiness and good order of the United States.

I consider this insurrection as the first formidable fruit of the Democratic Societies; brought forth I believe too prematurely for their own views, which may contribute to the annihilation of them. That these societies were instituted by the artful and designing members (many of their body I have no doubt mean well, but know little of the real plan,) primarily to sow the seeds of jealousy and distrust among the people, of the government, by destroying all confidence in the Administration of it, and perhaps with a hope of poisoning their minds and alienating their affections from the government of their own choice, I have not a doubt.

But I did not mean to make these observations to you, at this time. My intention was merely to acknowledge your letter, and to inform you that I shall always be ready to receive any communications you may think proper to make, and to give such answers to them as the nature of the case may require.

The proclamation was calculated for the rebellious counties, and I believe has had a good effect there. The measure of calling forth the militia was right, and I am well satisfied that it was the proper season for it. But the manner of doing it might have been improved. The Secretary of War should have had previous orders to make the necessary arrangements, so that when the President's authority was given, everything might have been in readiness for immediate execution.

I am clearly in sentiment with you, my dear Sir, that vigorous and decisive measures are necessary to maintain the authority of the government, and to convince all, that it is not to be triumphed over with impunity. But I am equally clear that these measures should be accompanied with every mark of moderation, and should be executed with all possible tenderness towards those who may have been misled, but are willing to return to their duty.

The insurgents have been much encouraged by the belief that the government would not dare to use force against them. It is therefore essential to convince them of their error, and to let all good citizens see that their government is both able and determined to support itself.

The laws must be enforced. The precedent which would be established by suffering the government to be insulted and its authority trampled upon, would be too dangerous to be permitted. It would encourage similar insurrections in other parts of the United States, and would ultimately destroy all government and order.

I trust that the measures we have adopted will be sufficient to restore order and tranquillity, without the necessity of proceeding to extremities. But if they should prove inadequate, we must not hesitate to use all the force which the Constitution and laws place at our disposal.

With sincere regard and esteem, I am, my dear Sir, your most obedient servant,

Go: Washington
