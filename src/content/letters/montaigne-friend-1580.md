My dearest Étienne,

Though you have been gone these seventeen years, I find myself writing to you still, for in death you remain my truest reader. I am compelled to tell you of this curious project that has consumed me - these "essays" or attempts at capturing the movements of my own mind. You would find it either fascinating or utterly mad, I cannot say which.

I am myself the matter of my book; you would be unreasonable to spend your leisure on so frivolous and vain a subject. Yet this is precisely what I have chosen to do - to study myself with the same attention philosophers give to the nature of justice or the movements of celestial spheres.

You remember how we used to debate whether it was possible to truly know another person? I have decided to begin with an even more fundamental question: is it possible to know oneself? The Oracle at Delphi commanded "Know thyself," but I find myself a more elusive subject than any ancient text.

Each morning I sit at my desk, not to argue great principles or defend universal truths, but simply to observe what Michel de Montaigne thinks and feels at this particular moment. Yesterday I wrote about my fear of pain, today about my love of books, tomorrow perhaps about my changing opinions on friendship or marriage. I am like a painter who uses himself as model for every figure in his canvas.

What astounds me is how inconsistent I am! The man who writes in the morning often disagrees with the one who wrote the evening before. I contradict myself not just from year to year but from page to page. Rather than being disturbed by this, I find it liberating. Why should human nature be more consistent than weather or the behavior of streams?

I have abandoned the pretense that my thoughts are systematic or my wisdom complete. Instead, I offer only "essays" - attempts, trials, explorations. Each piece begins with a simple observation or memory and follows wherever my mind wanders. Sometimes I discover things about myself that surprise me more than any reader will be surprised.

You always said I was too fond of ancient books. Now I find myself quoting Plutarch and Seneca not as authorities but as fellow travelers in the journey of self-understanding. When Cicero writes about old age, I measure his words against my own experience of watching my hair gray and my vigor decline. The ancients become conversation partners rather than masters.

But here is what I have learned that would delight you: in writing about myself with complete honesty, I seem to be writing about everyone. My peculiar fears turn out to be universal anxieties. My private joys echo in readers' hearts. The more specifically I describe Michel de Montaigne, the more people recognize themselves in these pages.

Perhaps this is because I refuse to present myself as exemplary. I am neither sage nor saint, neither hero nor villain, but simply a man trying to understand what it means to be human. I write about my weaknesses as readily as my strengths, my foolishness alongside whatever wisdom I may possess.

The form itself has become a kind of philosophy. By refusing to argue systematically for particular positions, I demonstrate the complexity and mutability of human consciousness. Each essay is like a mind thinking out loud, complete with digressions, second thoughts, and contradictions.

I find great freedom in saying "What do I know?" - your motto that I have adopted. This skeptical questioning liberates me from the burden of defending fixed doctrines. Instead, I can explore ideas playfully, turn them over like interesting stones, see how they catch the light from different angles.

My critics say this approach is merely self-indulgent, that philosophy should concern itself with eternal truths rather than the fluctuations of one man's mind. But I suspect they mistake consistency for truth and system for wisdom. The human condition is not systematic, so why should our reflection upon it be?

You would appreciate this paradox: by taking myself as subject, I have learned to think less of myself. Honest self-examination is profoundly humbling. The more carefully I observe my own thoughts and motives, the less inclined I am to judge others harshly. We are all more contradictory, more irrational, more influenced by circumstance than we care to admit.

I write in my study surrounded by your books - the ones you loved, the ones we discussed during those golden afternoons in your library. Sometimes I feel as if our old conversations continue through this writing. I pose a question to the page, and somehow your voice joins the chorus of ancient authors and my own uncertain reflections.

The essays have taught me to be comfortable with uncertainty, to find pleasure in questions that have no final answers. This seems to me a particularly valuable lesson in an age when religious and political certainties clash with such violence. Perhaps what the world needs is not more people who are absolutely sure they are right, but more people willing to say "I am still learning."

I dedicate this strange project to your memory, dear friend, for you taught me that true friendship means showing oneself completely to another - flaws, contradictions, fears, and all. These essays are my attempt to extend that same radical honesty to any reader brave enough to accompany me in this exploration of human nature.

Your eternal friend,
Michel

P.S. - I am revising constantly. Each time I return to an essay, I see new aspects of the question or discover that my opinions have shifted. I think you would enjoy the irony: a book about the inconsistency of human nature that demonstrates that inconsistency by changing even as it is being written.
