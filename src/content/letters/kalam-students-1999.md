My dear young friends,

As I write this letter to you, I am reminded of my own childhood in Rameswaram, where I used to watch birds soar high above the ocean and wonder about the mysteries of flight. Today, having spent decades working with rockets and missiles that carry our dreams to space, I want to share with you some thoughts that might help you shape your own journey toward greatness.

You have to dream before your dreams can come true. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action. This is not merely poetry - this is the fundamental process by which human beings achieve the impossible. Every satellite we launch, every missile we perfect, every scientific breakthrough begins as a dream in someone's young mind.

I want you to understand that you are living in the most exciting time in human history. The knowledge that took centuries to accumulate is now available at your fingertips. The barriers that once separated nations, cultures, and peoples are dissolving through technology. You have opportunities that previous generations could never imagine. But with these opportunities comes immense responsibility.

India stands at a crossroads. We can either remain a developing nation, dependent on others for our technology and innovation, or we can transform ourselves into a developed nation that leads the world in science, technology, and human values. This transformation will not happen through government policies alone - it will happen through you, the young minds who will shape the next fifty years.

Let me tell you what I see when I look at India's future. I see a nation where every village is connected through fiber optic networks, where farmers use satellite data to optimize their crops, where our cities run on clean energy generated by advanced technology, where our youth contribute to cutting-edge research in biotechnology, space science, and information systems.

This is not fantasy - this is achievable. But it requires you to think differently about your role in society. You cannot be passive consumers of education; you must become active creators of knowledge. You cannot be satisfied with just getting a job; you must become entrepreneurs who create jobs for others. You cannot be content with personal success alone; you must work for the upliftment of the entire nation.

When I was working on the SLV-3 project, our first indigenous satellite launch vehicle, we faced countless failures. Each failure taught us something new, brought us closer to success. The day we successfully launched Rohini satellite into orbit, the entire nation celebrated. But what made me proudest was seeing young engineers and scientists who had worked tirelessly, learning from failures, never giving up on their dreams.

This is what I want from you - the courage to dream big, the persistence to work through failures, and the wisdom to learn from every experience. Science and technology are not just subjects to be studied in books; they are tools for solving real problems that affect millions of people.

Look around you and identify problems that need solutions. Can you develop a cost-effective water purification system for rural areas? Can you create educational technology that makes quality learning accessible to every child? Can you design sustainable energy solutions for remote villages? Can you build bridges between ancient wisdom and modern knowledge?

These challenges require not just technical knowledge but also moral courage, ethical thinking, and deep compassion for human suffering. A true scientist or engineer is not just someone who understands formulas and equations, but someone who uses knowledge in service of humanity.

I have met thousands of young people across India, and I am constantly amazed by your creativity, your energy, and your desire to make a difference. But I also notice that many of you are held back by self-doubt, by the belief that innovation and leadership are only for others, not for you.

Let me tell you clearly - you are wrong. Every one of you has unique talents, unique perspectives, unique contributions to make. The boy selling newspapers on the street corner has insights about information distribution that could revolutionize media. The girl struggling with mathematics might discover new ways to make complex concepts simple for others.

Your background does not determine your future. I came from a humble family, my father rented out boats to pilgrims, and we often struggled to make ends meet. But I had dreams, I had curiosity, and I had the support of teachers who believed in me. Today, you have even greater opportunities than I had.

What matters is not where you come from but where you want to go. What matters is not your current limitations but your willingness to overcome them. What matters is not what others think about your capabilities but what you think about your own potential.

I want you to become leaders - not just in your careers but in your thinking. Leadership is not about having authority over others; it is about taking responsibility for solving problems that others ignore. Leadership is not about being popular; it is about being useful. Leadership is not about personal glory; it is about national transformation.

Develop three essential qualities that every leader needs: First, the ability to think independently and critically. Don't accept things just because everyone else does. Question, analyze, experiment. Second, the courage to take risks and face failures. Great achievements always involve uncertainty and setbacks. Third, the compassion to use your talents for the benefit of others, especially those who are less fortunate.

Read voraciously - not just textbooks but biographies of great scientists, stories of innovations, accounts of how problems were solved in different parts of the world. Meet people from different backgrounds, listen to their experiences, understand their challenges. Travel whenever possible, but more importantly, travel within your own mind - explore new ideas, new possibilities, new ways of thinking.

Learn to work in teams. The days when individual genius could solve all problems are gone. Modern challenges require diverse skills, collaborative effort, and shared vision. Learn to communicate your ideas clearly, to listen to others respectfully, to build consensus around common goals.

Most importantly, never lose your sense of wonder. The moment you stop being curious about how things work, why things happen, what could be improved, you stop growing. Every great scientist I know retained the curiosity of a child throughout their life.

As you prepare for your future careers, remember that the jobs you will eventually do may not even exist today. Technology is advancing so rapidly that new professions are being created every few years. Instead of preparing for specific jobs, prepare your minds to be adaptable, creative, and continuously learning.

My dear young friends, I have spent my life working with rockets and missiles, but my greatest joy comes from meeting students like you who remind me that the future is bright, that India's best days are ahead of us, that the dreams we shared during the freedom movement will finally be realized through your generation.

You are the architects of India's destiny. You are the scientists who will make breakthrough discoveries, the engineers who will build world-class infrastructure, the entrepreneurs who will create global companies, the leaders who will guide our nation to prosperity and peace.

Dream, dare, and do. The nation is waiting for your contributions. The world is waiting for your innovations. History is waiting for your leadership.

Your friend and guide in this magnificent journey,

A.P.J. Abdul Kalam

P.S. - Remember, when you climb a mountain, the summit seems impossible from the bottom. But every step upward makes the impossible seem less impossible. Keep taking those steps, one at a time, and you will reach heights you never imagined possible.
