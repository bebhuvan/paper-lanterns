To Atticus, greetings.

The die is cast. Caesar has crossed the Rubicon with his army. The Republic trembles, and I fear what is to come.

You ask what I think of these present troubles. I am utterly at a loss. Indeed, I have never been in greater doubt about any matter. On the one side I see Caesar with many legions, many auxiliary troops, the incredible devotion of his soldiers, and resources that seem unlimited. On the other side, I see the cause of the Republic, the authority of the Senate, and the support of all good men.

But what weighs most heavily on my mind is this: I cannot determine which course honor demands. If I follow Pompey and the Senate, I may be supporting the right cause but aligning myself with those whose methods I cannot always approve. If I remain neutral, I abandon my duty to the Republic in its hour of greatest need.

Caesar's letter to me was courteous enough. He writes that he values my friendship above all others and begs me not to take sides against him. He promises that he seeks only what is his due - a second consulship and the triumph that the Senate has so long denied him. But can we trust the word of one who brings armed legions across the sacred boundary of Italy?

The speed of events astounds me. Only days ago we thought Caesar would negotiate, that some compromise might be reached. Now his cavalry patrols the roads to Rome, and Pompey speaks of abandoning the city itself. How quickly the mighty edifice of our Republic crumbles when tested by the ambition of one man!

I think constantly of our conversations about the nature of government and the duties of citizenship. You have always counseled prudence, urging me to avoid the extremes of faction. But can there be neutrality when the very foundations of our state are under attack? When Caesar's soldiers march on Rome, is it not the duty of every citizen to resist?

Yet I confess, my friend, that I am torn by doubts. Caesar has been my colleague, and I cannot forget his courtesy to me in past years. Moreover, I see among his enemies men whose motives are no purer than his own - men who oppose him not from love of the Republic but from envy of his success.

The common people seem almost to welcome this upheaval. They remember Caesar's generosity, his games, his distributions of grain. They care little for the constitutional niceties that so concern us senators. Perhaps they are right to think that the Republic has served them poorly, that any change might bring improvement to their lot.

But I cannot shake the conviction that we stand at a crossroads of history. If Caesar succeeds in this enterprise, if he can march on Rome with impunity and bend the Senate to his will, what becomes of the law? What becomes of the traditions that have made Rome great? Will we exchange our birthright of freedom for the promise of order under one man's rule?

I have decided, after much anguish, to join Pompey and the forces of the Republic. I cannot stand aside while our ancient liberties are trampled underfoot. Better to fail in a noble cause than to succeed in an ignoble one.

Pray for Rome, my dear Atticus. Pray that wisdom may yet prevail, and that this madness may end before our beloved city is consumed by civil war.

Your friend,
Cicero
