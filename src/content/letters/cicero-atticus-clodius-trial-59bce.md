about:
  context: "Written in 59 BCE, this letter explains one of the most scandalous trials in Roman history. Clodius had been caught disguised as a woman at the sacred Bona Dea festival, but was acquitted through massive bribery, setting the stage for his later persecution of Cicero."
  significance: "This letter provides invaluable insight into the corruption that plagued the late Roman Republic. Clodius would later become Cicero's greatest enemy, forcing him into exile in 58 BCE. The letter demonstrates how justice could be bought in Rome."
  author_bio: "Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BCE) was Rome's greatest orator and a defender of republican government. His extensive correspondence provides our best source for understanding the collapse of the Roman Republic."
  recipient_info: "Titus Pomponius Atticus (110-32 BCE) was Cicero's closest friend and confidant. An Epicurean philosopher and wealthy businessman, he remained politically neutral while providing Cicero with both friendship and financial support."

My Dear Atticus,

You ask how Clodius came to be acquitted. The matter is easy enough to understand if you know what a trial is like nowadays. The iudices took their seats with such a stern air that the populace began to hope for once that a guilty man would be punished. Clodius himself was so downcast that everyone thought his case hopeless.

But then Crassus the Rich made his move. You know how these things work—money changed hands faster than a chariot race at the Circus Maximus. The jury received their payment, and suddenly the atmosphere in the court changed entirely.

The most shameless thing of all was this: before the case came to trial, the jury demanded their money in advance! Can you imagine such brazenness? Not only did they sell their votes, but they had the audacity to demand payment before even hearing the evidence. Some of the iudices were not content merely to receive money; they stipulated for assignations with certain women and introductions to youths of noble family.

On the day of the trial itself, our noble iudices came to court with their bodyguards—not to protect themselves from Clodius's mob, mind you, but to keep honest citizens from seeing the money being passed around! They were more afraid of being caught in the act of taking bribes than they were of the actual criminal on trial.

When the votes were counted, we had thirty-one for conviction and twenty-five for acquittal. One of the iudices, when asked afterward why he had voted for acquittal, replied quite seriously: "Why should we have exposed ourselves to danger for nothing?" As if endangering themselves was the issue, rather than the sacred duty of upholding justice!

The most maddening part is that Clodius now struts around Rome as if he were some great hero instead of a man who defiled the most sacred mysteries of our religion. He violated the rites of the Bona Dea, where no man is permitted, and then bought his way out of punishment. What does this say about the state of our republic?

I fear, my dear friend, that we are witnessing the death throes of justice in Rome. When a man can commit sacrilege in the sight of the gods and then purchase his freedom with gold, what hope is there for honest citizens? When juries openly demand bribes and boast of their corruption, how can we maintain any faith in our courts?

Mark my words: this acquittal will come back to haunt us all. A man who would defile sacred rites and buy his way out of punishment will not hesitate to commit even greater outrages. Clodius is like a disease that we had the chance to cure, but instead we have allowed it to spread throughout the body of the republic.

I write this not just to answer your question, but to record for posterity how justice died in Rome—not with a sword, but with a purse full of gold.

Vale, my dear Atticus. May the gods preserve what little virtue remains in our city.

Cicero
