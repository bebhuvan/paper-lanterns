My dear Tacitus,

You ask me to write you something about the death of my uncle so that you can leave an accurate account of it for posterity. I thank you, for I see that his death will be remembered forever if you treat it in your histories.

On 24 August, in the early afternoon, my mother drew his attention to a cloud of unusual size and appearance. He had been out in the sun, had taken a cold bath, and lunched while lying down, and was then working at his books. He called for his shoes and climbed up to a place which would give him the best view of the phenomenon.

It was not clear at that distance from which mountain the cloud was rising (it was afterwards known to be Vesuvius); its general appearance can best be expressed as being like an umbrella pine, for it rose to a great height on a sort of trunk and then split off into branches. I imagine because it was thrust upwards by the first blast and then left unsupported as the pressure subsided, or else it was borne down by its own weight so that it spread out and gradually dispersed.

In places it looked white, elsewhere blotched and dirty, according to the amount of soil and ashes it carried with you.

My uncle's scholarly acumen saw at once that it was important enough for a closer inspection, and he ordered a boat to be made ready. He offered me the opportunity of coming with him if I wished, but I replied that I preferred to go on with my studies, and as it happened he had himself given me some writing to do.

As he was leaving the house he was handed a message from Rectina, wife of Bassus, who was terrified by the danger threatening her. Her villa lay at the foot of Vesuvius, and there was no way of escape except by boat. She implored him to rescue her from her fate. He changed his plans, and what he had begun in a spirit of inquiry he completed as a hero.

Meanwhile on Mount Vesuvius broad sheets of fire and leaping flames blazed at a number of points, their bright glare emphasized by the darkness of night. My uncle tried to allay the fears of his companions by repeatedly declaring that these were nothing but bonfires left by the peasants in their terror, or else empty houses on fire in the districts they had abandoned.

You could hear the shrieks of women, the wailing of infants, and the shouting of men; some were calling their parents, others their children or their wives, trying to recognize them by their voices. People bewailed their own fate or that of their relatives, and there were some who prayed for death in their terror of dying. Many besought the aid of the gods, but still more imagined there were no gods left, and that the universe was plunged into eternal darkness for evermore.

The buildings were now shaking with violent shocks, and seemed to be swaying to and fro as if they were torn from their foundations. Outside, on the other hand, there was the danger of falling pumice stones, even though these were light and porous.

For myself, I cannot boast that no groan or cry of fear escaped me in these perils, but I can say that I found some poor consolation in my belief that the whole world was dying with me and I with it.

Pliny
