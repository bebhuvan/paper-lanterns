To Mahatma Gandhi.
YASNAYA POLYANA.
8th May 1910.

Dear friend,

I have just received your letter and your book, Indian Home Rule.

I read your book with great interest because I think the question you treat in it: the passive resistance — is a question of the greatest importance, not only for India but for the whole humanity.

I could not find your former letters, but came across your biography by J. Doss, which too interested me much and gave me the possibility to know and understand your letter.

I am not quite well at present and therefore abstain from writing to you all what I have to say about your book and all your work, which I appreciate very much, but I will do it as soon, as I will feel better.

Your friend and brother
Leo Tolstoy
