  context: "This letter is Du Bois's response to Ambedkar's inquiry about the Negro petition to the United Nations. Written on the same day as Ambedkar's original letter, it shows the immediacy and importance both leaders placed on international civil rights cooperation."
  significance: "This response demonstrates Du Bois's international perspective on civil rights and his recognition of the parallels between racial oppression in America and caste oppression in India. It marks an early example of global civil rights solidarity."

31 July 1946

My dear Mr. Ambedkar:

I have your letter concerning the case of the Negroes of America and the Untouchables in India before the United Nations. As you say a small organization of American Negroes, the National Negro Congress, has already made a statement which I am enclosing. I think, however, that a much more comprehensive statement well documented will eventually be laid before the United Nations by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. If this is done I shall be glad to send you a copy.

I have often heard of your name and work and of course have every sympathy with the Untouchables of India. I shall be glad to be of any service I can render if possible in the future.

Very sincerely yours,  
W. E. B. Du Bois
