What a man you are! What a man you have always been! Your 'Leaves of Grass' was a boon to me. It cheered me in dark hours, it lifted me up when I was down, it was a light in the darkness.

I have been meaning to write to you for years, Walt, but somehow the right words never seemed to come. How does one thank a man for changing the way he sees the world? How does one express gratitude for a voice that speaks so directly to the American soul?

When I first encountered your verses, I confess I was puzzled. Here was poetry unlike anything I had read—no forced rhymes, no artificial prettiness, but something raw and true and utterly alive. It took me time to understand that this was exactly what American poetry needed to be.

You have taught me that there is poetry in the common man, in the rough speech of the frontier, in the honest sweat of labor. You have shown us that we need not ape the forms of Europe, that we can sing our own song in our own way.

I have tried, in my own humble fashion, to capture something of the American voice in my stories. When people ask me about my influences, I think of you—of your democracy of language, your embrace of the vernacular, your faith in the essential dignity of ordinary people.

You have been a liberator, Walt, not just of poetry but of the American imagination. You have given us permission to be ourselves, to speak as we really speak, to find the sacred in the profane and the noble in the commonplace.

The critics may carp and the proper folk may frown, but you and I know the truth: America is not in drawing rooms and parlors but on the docks and in the factories, on the riverboats and in the mining camps. That is where the real poetry is, and you were the first to have the courage to say so.

I salute you, old friend, across the miles and the years. May your voice continue to echo long after we are both gone, reminding future generations what it means to be truly free.
