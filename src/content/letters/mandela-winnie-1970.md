There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere, and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires. But I do not despair, my darling, for I know that the human spirit cannot be broken.

My beloved Winnie, as I write this letter in my cell, the sound of the ocean washing against Robben Island reminds me that even these walls cannot contain the vastness of my love for you, or my faith in the ultimate triumph of justice.

The authorities can imprison my body, but they cannot imprison my mind. In the solitude of this place, I have discovered resources within myself that I never knew existed. The cell is an ideal place to learn to know yourself, to search realistically and regularly the process of your own mind and feelings.

I think often of the day when we will walk together again as free people in a free South Africa. I see our children grown and proud, contributing to the building of a society where the color of one's skin is no more significant than the color of one's eyes. This vision sustains me through the longest nights and the hardest days.

They have taken away my freedom of movement, but they cannot take away my freedom to think, to hope, to love. In my mind, I travel with you through the streets of Soweto, I sit with you in the evening planning the future of our people, I hold you close and feel your heartbeat against mine.

The warders here are not evil men, my darling. They are products of a system that teaches fear and hatred. Some have even begun to see me not as a terrorist, as their superiors label me, but as a fellow human being. This gives me hope that if we can change hearts here in this place of maximum security, we can change hearts everywhere.

I read voraciouslyâ€”Shakespeare and Tolstoy, the poems of Yeats and the philosophy of Gandhi. These great voices of humanity remind me that struggle against injustice is as old as civilization itself, and that those who fight for freedom always eventually prevail, though the road may be long and the cost high.

Physical suffering is nothing, darling, compared to the pain of separation from you and our children. But I would endure a thousand times this agony rather than compromise the principles for which I was imprisoned. Our love must be strong enough to survive this trial, because the day will come when we will be reunited not just as husband and wife, but as citizens of a free nation.

Keep the flame burning, my love. Keep fighting. Keep believing. The dawn will come.
