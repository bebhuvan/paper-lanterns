Dear Brother Battu,

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I know these are difficult times for all of us, but we must remember why we chose this path.

I have received the news of our sentences. I am anxiously waiting for the day when I will embrace the gallows. It will demonstrate to the world how bravely the revolutionaries can sacrifice themselves for the cause. We must show that we are not afraid of death, but welcome it as a friend when it comes in service of our motherland.

You have received a life sentence, and I know this may seem harder to bear than my death sentence. But remember, brother, that you have been given the opportunity to continue serving our cause for many years to come. This is not a lesser sacrifice, but a different kind of sacrifice - perhaps even greater.

In the years ahead, you will have the chance to keep our revolutionary spirit alive. You will be able to inspire new generations of fighters. You will be the living testimony of our movement when I am gone. This is a tremendous responsibility, but I have complete faith in your ability to bear it with honor.

Do not let the darkness of prison walls dim the fire in your heart. Remember that every day you spend in jail with dignity and courage is a victory for our cause. Every moment you refuse to bow down to oppression is a step toward freedom for our country.

I want you to know that I am proud to have had you as my comrade. Our action in the Assembly may not have achieved immediate political results, but it has certainly awakened the people. The very fact that they are so afraid of us that they keep us in solitary confinement shows the power of our message.

Keep reading, keep thinking, keep your mind sharp. Study the works of great revolutionaries. Learn from their experiences. Prepare yourself for the role you will play when you emerge from prison. The revolution needs intellectuals as much as it needs martyrs.

I am writing to you not with sadness but with joy. Joy that we have been chosen to play our parts in this great drama of freedom. Joy that we will be remembered as those who refused to compromise with injustice. Joy that our sacrifice will water the tree of liberty.

Do not worry about me. I am in excellent health and my spirits are higher than ever. I spend my time reading, writing, and thinking about our country's future. I am convinced that independence is not far away, and our sacrifice will have contributed to that glorious day.

Remember our slogan: "Inquilab Zindabad!" Revolution lives on, brother, even when revolutionaries die. Keep this flame burning in your heart, and help others light their torches from it.

Give my regards to other comrades if you get a chance to meet them. Tell them that Bhagat Singh went to the gallows with a smile, singing songs of revolution.

Until we meet again, either in this world or the next, keep the red flag flying high.

Your comrade,
Bhagat Singh

P.S. - Remember, the blood of martyrs is the seed of revolution. My blood will water the ground, but you must tend the garden.
