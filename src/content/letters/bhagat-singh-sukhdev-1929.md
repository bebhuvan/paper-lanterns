My dear Brother Sukhdev,

I have come to know that some people have been spreading stories about my so-called "weakness" and change of heart. I feel it necessary to clarify my position to you, as you are not only my dearest friend but also my comrade in this sacred struggle.

People seem to think that because I have spoken about love and the beauty of life, I have somehow become weak or that my revolutionary spirit has diminished. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of what I believe and who I am.

I am full of ambition and hope and of full charm of life. But I can renounce all at the time of need, and that is the real sacrifice. This seems to be the difference between me and other people. People sacrifice their love when they have no love to sacrifice. They sacrifice their lives when life has become a burden to them. But when one is full of life and love, and yet renounces them for a cause, that is the real sacrifice.

I do not hate life. On the contrary, I love it immensely. I love the morning sun, the chirping of birds, the laughter of children, the beauty of nature, the company of friends, and yes, even the possibility of love and marriage. Life has so much to offer, and I am aware of all its attractions.

But precisely because I love life so much, I am willing to give it up for something greater than life itself - the freedom of my motherland. If I were indifferent to life, my sacrifice would be meaningless. It is because life is precious to me that my offering of it has value.

Some people have also questioned my views on love and relationships. Let me be clear: I believe in love, and I think it is one of the most beautiful experiences human beings can have. I have not renounced love because I think it is evil or unworthy. I have renounced it because, at this moment in history, my country needs my complete attention and devotion.

A revolutionary must be prepared to sacrifice everything - comfort, wealth, family, love, and ultimately life itself. But this sacrifice must come from strength, not weakness; from fullness, not emptiness; from choice, not compulsion.

I want you to understand that I have not become soft or sentimental. My commitment to our cause remains absolute. I am prepared to face any consequence, including death, for our revolutionary activities. But I refuse to become a machine or to lose my humanity in the process.

We are fighting for a better world, a world where love and beauty and joy will flourish. If we lose our capacity to appreciate these things in our struggle to create that world, what would be the point of our revolution?

I know there are those who think a revolutionary should be hard, cold, and emotionless. But I believe that the best revolutionaries are those who fight precisely because they love life and want to make it better for everyone. Hatred alone cannot sustain a revolution; it must be fueled by love - love for humanity, love for justice, love for freedom.

My dear friend, I hope you understand my position. I remain as committed as ever to our cause. I am ready to make any sacrifice that may be required. But I will not pretend to be something I am not, nor will I apologize for retaining my humanity and my appreciation for the beauty of existence.

We must remain true to ourselves even as we struggle to transform the world. Only then can our revolution truly succeed in creating a better society.

The path we have chosen is dangerous, and we may not live to see the fruits of our struggle. But let us walk this path with courage, with dignity, and with our hearts full of love for the world we are trying to create.

Keep the fire of revolution burning in your heart, but do not let it consume your humanity. We fight not because we hate what exists, but because we love what could be.

Your brother,
Bhagat Singh

P.S. - Remember, the revolution needs warriors, but it also needs poets, lovers, and dreamers. We must be all of these things.
