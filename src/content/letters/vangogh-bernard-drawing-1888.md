What is drawing? How does one get there? It's working one's way through an invisible iron wall that seems to stand between what one feels and what one can do. How can one get through that wall? One must not step back from it, in my opinion. One must attack the wall with hammers and drive on relentlessly.

And I find drawing and the thought so absorbing that I really believe that one could think oneself into a state of greater serenity, and that many troubles would disappear if one concentrated more on what one sees with one's own eyes and acts according to one's own temperament.

My whole life is aimed at making the things from everyday life express something urgent. I want to show people that there is something admirable and precious in the life of the poorest peasant or in the dustiest corner.

I dream of a red tree on yellow soil, beneath a green sky and a blazing sun. The ordinary things are not ordinary to me. I see colors where others see shadows, and in those colors I find what it means to be alive.

The work — ah, the work consumes me utterly. Sometimes I paint from dawn until the stars appear, and still feel I have barely begun to capture what burns so fiercely in my mind. But this is not madness, dear Bernard, though others may call it so. This is the only way I know to make sense of this beautiful, terrible world.

Do you understand what I mean when I say that painting is a faith? Not faith in God, necessarily, but faith in the power of human hands and eyes and heart to transform the mundane into something that sings?
