Godmersham Park, Thursday (November 20, 1800).

My dearest Cassandra,

I have so much to tell you of yesterday evening, that I scarcely know where to begin. The ball at Ashford Assembly was everything that could be wished, and I am still quite transported by the delights of the evening.

The company was most brilliant—above sixty people, and among them some who had traveled considerable distances for the occasion. Lady Bridges looked remarkably well in a gown of the finest Indian muslin with silver trim, while her daughters were all elegance in their white crepe. I myself wore my white gown with the worked muslin over it, and had the satisfaction of several compliments upon my appearance.

There were twenty dances, & I danced them all, & without any fatigue. It was the same room in which we danced 15 years ago! I thought it all over, & in spite of the shame of being so much older, felt with thankfulness that I was quite as happy now as then. The evening began with a minuet, which was performed by only four couple, but it was executed with such grace that it set the tone for all that followed.

I was engaged for the first two dances by Mr. William Chute, who proved an excellent partner, light on his feet and thoroughly conversant with the figures. During the third and fourth, I was claimed by young Mr. Hoare from Canterbury, whose enthusiasm more than compensated for what he lacked in polish. Between dances, I had the most amusing conversation with Mrs. Lefroy about the shocking increase in the price of tea, which she attributes entirely to the war with France.

The most remarkable couple was undoubtedly Miss Harriet Hales and Captain Morrison of the militia. She wore a gown of the deepest blue silk that became her wonderfully, while he was resplendent in his regimentals. They danced together no fewer than six times, causing considerable whispers among the chaperones. I confess I watched them with great interest, for there seemed to be some particular understanding between them.

The refreshments were more elaborate than usual—not merely the customary tea and negus, but quite a sumptuous spread including jellies, blanc-mange, and the finest white soup I have tasted outside of London. The card tables were set up in the adjoining room for those who preferred that amusement, though I noticed most of the younger people remained devoted to dancing.

I must tell you of the most diverting incident of the evening. During a country dance, Miss Benn made such an unfortunate step that she nearly brought down the entire set! The poor creature turned quite scarlet, but was soon laughing along with the rest of us when young Mr. Terry declared it the most original figure he had ever witnessed. Her good humor in the face of such embarrassment quite won everyone's admiration.

The musicians—three violins and a violoncello from Maidstone—played with spirit throughout the evening, and we had several of the newest country dances from London. I was particularly pleased that they knew "The Duke of York's March," which has such a lively air. The dancing continued until past midnight, when we concluded with "God Save the King" and the most elaborate courtesies.

Edward proved himself an admirable host, ensuring that every lady was engaged for every dance and that the refreshments never ran low. I believe the evening will be spoken of throughout the county for some time to come.

Now I must close, as breakfast is being served and I have promised to walk with Fanny to see the improvements in the shrubbery. Give my tenderest love to my dear mother and father, and tell them how well Edward looks and how handsomely he does the honors of his house.

Write to me soon, dearest sister, and tell me all the news from home. I long to hear whether our father has finished pruning the apple trees, and whether Martha has recovered from her cold.

Your most affectionate sister,
Jane

P.S.—I almost forgot to mention that I heard from two separate sources that Mrs. Knatchbull's eldest daughter is soon to be engaged to a gentleman from Berkshire. The news has not been formally announced, but I thought you would wish to know, as you were always partial to Miss Knatchbull's agreeable manners.
