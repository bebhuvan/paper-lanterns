about:
  context: "This letter accompanied the joint presentation to the Linnean Society on July 1, 1858, where Darwin and Wallace's theories of evolution by natural selection were first presented to the scientific community. The coincidental development of identical theories led to one of science's most famous collaborations."
  significance: "This letter marks the moment when evolutionary theory entered public scientific discourse. The gracious handling of the potential priority dispute between Darwin and Wallace became a model for scientific collaboration and established natural selection as a cornerstone of modern biology."
  author_bio: "Charles Darwin (1809-1882) developed the theory of evolution by natural selection during his voyage on HMS Beagle and decades of subsequent research. His meticulous approach to gathering evidence revolutionized biology and our understanding of life on Earth."
  recipient_info: "Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913) independently conceived the theory of natural selection while studying biogeography in the Malay Archipelago. His collaboration with Darwin demonstrated the power of scientific integrity over personal ambition."

My dear Lyell,

Some year or so ago you recommended me to read a paper by Wallace in the 'Annals,' which had interested you, and, as I was writing to him, I knew it would please him much to be thus noticed by you. He has to-day sent me the enclosed, and asked me to forward it to you. It seems to me well worth reading. Your words have come true with a vengeance,—that I should be forestalled.

I never saw a more striking coincidence; if Wallace had my manuscript sketch written out in 1842, he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters. Please return me the manuscript, which he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal. So all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed, though my book, if it will ever have any value, will not be deteriorated; as all the labour consists in the application of the theory.

I hope you will approve of Wallace's sketch. I am not in the least annoyed that Wallace has anticipated me. The one great service which my work may do, is that it may aid in bringing about the gradual change of opinion which I believe is slowly coming over the minds of naturalists with regard to the immutability of species.

I would far rather burn my whole book, than that he or any other man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit. Do you not think that this sketch ties together very well the several classes of facts?

If you think well of Wallace's essay, would you be so kind as to forward it to Hooker? I should be grateful if you would consider, along with Hooker, whether this paper should be published, and if so, whether you both think it would be proper for me to send a chapter from my larger work to be published at the same time.

I am quite prostrated, and can do nothing, but I send Wallace's paper and my abstract of my theory, which you have already seen. I dare say it will be too long for the Linnean Society Transactions. I trust that my conduct in this matter has been honourable and proper.

Whatever you and Hooker think best, I will acquiesce in. I am in great haste, as Emma is not well, and I am much engaged.

Most truly yours,
Charles Darwin

P.S.—I have just reread your letter, and I see you doubt whether I have made my meaning clear about the manuscript which I sent you. What I meant was, that I have for many years been slowly preparing this work, and that Wallace's paper was the immediate cause of my resolving to publish an abstract. I think it would be dishonourable in me to publish first, merely because I have written out my ideas more fully. I would far rather burn my whole book than that he or any man should think I had behaved in a paltry spirit.
