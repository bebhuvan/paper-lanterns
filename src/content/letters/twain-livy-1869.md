My Darling, My Dear, Dear Livy,

I do not want to think of love as a sentiment, Livy—I want to think of it as a mighty force, a living presence, a reality that can make itself felt and known. And I want to think of you as the sweetest spirit that God ever created, and the dearest to my heart of all that dwell upon the earth.

You are my world, Livy—you are my Bible—you are my religion. Without you I am nothing. With you I can do all things, attempt all things, accomplish all things. You make me better than I am—you make me want to be better than I ever dreamed of being.

I love you with a love that is born of the deepest conviction that you are all that is pure and beautiful and noble in womanhood. I love you with a love that asks no questions and needs no reasons—a love that simply exists because it must exist, as surely as the sun must shine.

When I think of our life together—our beautiful life that is to be—I am filled with such a great, glad happiness that I wonder how my heart can contain it all. We will build such a home, Livy, such a sanctuary of love and peace and all good things.

You have already begun to make me better, dearer girl. Your gentle influence has already begun its blessed work upon my character. Continue to be patient with me, to bear with my shortcomings, and in time you shall see such improvement in me as will surprise us both.
