I am aware that the conclusion at which I have arrived will be denounced by many as highly irreligious, but he who denounces it is bound to show why it is more irreligious to explain the origin of man as a distinct species by descent from other forms, through the laws of variation and natural selection, than to explain the birth of the individual through the laws of ordinary reproduction.

The birth both of the species and of the individual are equally parts of that grand sequence of events which our minds refuse to accept as the result of blind chance. The understanding revolts at such a conclusion, whether or not man be looked at as a special creation, or as the product of general laws.

I have said that in one sense it goes against the grain of all my feelings; but I think these feelings will be modified when the facts are better known. I believe that the time will come when this view will be generally accepted by naturalists.

Many thanks for your most kind and valuable letter. I have been particularly glad to hear your views, which will have great weight with me. I know that I may trust to your kindness to forgive the freedom with which I write.
