I am reduced to a thing that wants Virginia. I composed a beautiful letter to you in the sleepless nightmare hours of the night, and it has all gone. I just miss you, in a quite simple desperate human way.

You, with all your undumb letters, would never write so elementary a phrase as that; perhaps you wouldn't even feel it. And yet I believe you'll be sensible of a little gap. But its no use going into all this.

What I was going to say was that if you were here I should be telling you about my solitude and my work, and how good it is, sometimes, and how I'm shooting out into the dark green waters again. The thing is that when I sit alone I can hear my mind working. It never stops. And that is why, though I can go for weeks seeing nobody, I am not bored. But I do want you.

Please, please, Vita, forgive this outburst. I was sitting alone after dinner last night and I suddenly thought of you, and it all rushed over me how much I miss you, and how empty things have been all this long time.

I had meant to write about work, about my novel, about the extraordinary way ideas come to me when I walk alone through London streets. But instead I find myself writing this — this confession of need, this admission of loneliness that sits so strangely with my fierce independence.

Yet what is writing, after all, but this very thing — the attempt to bridge the impossible distance between one mind and another, to say "I am here, I think this, I feel this" and hope that somewhere, someone understands?
