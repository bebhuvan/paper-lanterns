Dear Mr. Higginson,

You ask me to tell you more about my poetry, but how does one explain the act of catching lightning in words? I dwell in possibility - a fairer house than prose - more numerous of windows - superior for doors.

When I write, I am not seeking to decorate thoughts with pretty language. Rather, I hunt for the precise word that will split open a moment and reveal its hidden electricity. Yesterday, watching a hummingbird at the honeysuckle, I saw how it sipped eternity from each blossom. That seeing - that recognition of the infinite folded within the instant - this is what poetry must capture.

People speak of poets as dreamers lost in clouds, but I find poetry in the most ordinary moments made luminous by attention. The way dust motes dance in afternoon light. The sound of a door latching in an empty house. The precise quality of silence before dawn. These are not mere observations but glimpses of the sacred mechanics that operate behind the veil of daily life.

I write because I must, the way flowers must bloom or rivers must run toward the sea. The poems arrive unannounced - sometimes during morning baking, sometimes while walking in the garden. I have learned to keep paper nearby, for these visitations cannot be summoned, only received with gratitude.

You mention my unconventional punctuation, my fondness for dashes and capital letters. But how else to indicate the pauses where wonder lives? The places where the mind stops, struck by sudden recognition? Language as it is ordinarily written cannot hold the rhythms of thought, the way consciousness leaps and circles back upon itself.

My poetry is my way of corresponding with the infinite. Each poem is a letter sent to whatever force governs this strange, beautiful existence. Sometimes I fancy that eternity writes back through the cardinal's song or the way light falls across my writing desk at precisely three o'clock.

I know my verses seem strange to those accustomed to smoother rhymes and regular meters. But truth has its own music, often more angular and surprising than conventional melody. I write to the ear of the soul, not the ear that expects pretty sounds in predictable patterns.

In my garden this morning, I watched ants carrying crumbs along their invisible highways. Each ant knew its purpose with absolute certainty. This is how words must be in poems - each one essential, each one carrying exactly the weight required for the whole structure to stand.

You encourage me to publish more, but I confess a reluctance to send my thoughts into the public marketplace. Poetry feels too sacred for such commerce. When I write, I write for the one reader who will understand completely - perhaps that reader lives in this century, perhaps in the next. Time matters little to true communication between souls.

The world thinks me eccentric for my solitude, but I have found that silence is poetry's truest companion. In the spaces between heartbeats, between the tick and tock of the clock, between one thought and the next - there lies the material from which verses are made.

I hope these thoughts illuminate something about my practice, though I suspect poetry can no more be explained than can the flight of birds or the mathematics that govern the spiral of shells. We can observe, we can wonder, we can attempt to translate wonder into words - but the essential mystery remains beautifully intact.

Your Scholar,
E. Dickinson

P.S. - This afternoon I saw a snake in the garden and felt that sudden recognition - "a fellow feeling" - that tells me I have encountered material for a poem. How curious that fear and poetry spring from the same source: the shock of encountering what we did not expect.
