My dear friend Overbeck,

I have just now had all anti-Semites shot.

Dionysos

P.S. The world is transfigured, for God is on the earth. Do you not see how all the heavens rejoice? I have just now taken possession of my kingdom, am throwing the Pope into prison, and am having Wilhelm, Bismarck, and Stöcker shot.

Actually I would much rather be a Basel professor than God; but I have not dared to carry my private egoism so far as to omit for its sake the creation of the world. You see, one must make sacrifices however and wherever one lives.

But I have reserved for myself a small student room, situated opposite the Palazzo Carignano (in which I was born as Vittorio Emanuele) which moreover allows me to hear the magnificent music below in the Galleria Subalpina.

I am paying 25 francs including service.

The Crucified One
