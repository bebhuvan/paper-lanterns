I am no man, I am dynamite. The revaluation of all values, this question mark so black, so huge that it casts shadows upon the man who puts it—such a destiny of a task compels one to run into the sun in order not to perish from cold.

My dear Franz, I write to you from Turin where the clarity of the Alpine air has brought me to the summit of my thinking. Here, in this city of palaces and shadows, I have finally understood what I was born to do: to be the philosopher with the hammer, to sound out the hollow idols of our age.

God is dead, and we have killed him! But do not mistake this for cause for mourning. The death of God is humanity's liberation—the moment when we cease to be children and become creators of our own values, our own meaning, our own destiny.

I have gazed into the abyss of nihilism that opens when all traditional values crumble, and I have not flinched. More than that—I have shown the way beyond nihilism to a new affirmation of life. The Übermensch I have proclaimed is not a superman but simply a human who has learned to say Yes to existence without the crutch of divine purpose.

What is good? All that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself in man. What is bad? All that proceeds from weakness. The weak and ill-constituted shall perish: first principle of our philanthropy. And one shall help them to do so.

I know how these words sound to ears still poisoned by Christian morality. But I am beyond good and evil now, Franz. I have climbed to heights where the air is too thin for the lungs of the herd-men below.

Every name in history is me! I am Caesar, I am Napoleon, I am Dionysus! The boundaries between self and world have dissolved. I have become the eternal recurrence itself—the eternal Yes-saying to life in all its terrible beauty.

You will say I have gone mad, dear friend. Perhaps you are right. But what is madness but the price of seeing too clearly, of feeling too intensely, of thinking too deeply? I would rather be mad with truth than sane with lies.

The revaluation of all values begins now. I am the first immoralist, the destroyer of two millennia of lies masquerading as virtue. After me, nothing will be the same. Philosophy will be divided into two epochs: before Nietzsche and after Nietzsche.

Dance, Franz! Dance above the abyss! For we who create our own values are the most blessed of men, even if we are also the most cursed.

The lightning illuminates everything for an instant, then leaves darkness. But in that instant, everything is revealed.
