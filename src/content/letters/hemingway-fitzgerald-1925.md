Dear Scott,

Your letter reached me at Shakespeare and Company, where I was browsing through the latest arrivals from New York. Sylvia Beach sends her regards and asks when you might visit the shop again. She's been following the reviews of "The Great Gatsby" with great interest and pride in knowing you personally.

The good parts of a book may be only something a writer is lucky enough to overhear or it may be the wreck of his whole damn life—and one is as good as the other. I've been thinking about this a lot since reading your novel, which I believe is your finest work yet. There's something in those pages that goes beyond mere observation of the wealthy Long Island crowd - you've captured something essential about the American dream and its inevitable corruption.

Paris continues to be the perfect place for an American writer to develop his craft. The distance from home provides clarity about what we left behind, while the literary atmosphere here encourages experimentation that might seem pretentious back in the States. I write every morning at the café on Place Saint-Michel, watching the city wake up while I work on my stories. The routine has become sacred to me - coffee, notebook, the gradual emergence of something true from the blank page.

I've been working on a novel about our experiences during the war, though I'm still struggling with how to capture the reality of it without falling into either sentimentality or false heroics. The war changed all of us, but most people back home don't want to hear about the actual experience - they prefer their version, cleaned up and made meaningful. The challenge is to write truthfully about events that resist easy meaning.

Your advice about cutting unnecessary words has proven invaluable. I go through each sentence multiple times, removing anything that doesn't contribute directly to the effect I'm trying to create. The iceberg theory, as I've come to think of it - the part that shows should be supported by a much larger part that doesn't show but gives the visible part its strength and authenticity.

Hadley and I often talk about you and Zelda, wondering how you're managing the demands of success alongside the work of writing. Fame can be as destructive to a writer as poverty, though in different ways. The pressure to repeat previous successes, the social obligations that eat into writing time, the temptation to write for the market rather than from genuine conviction - these are real dangers for any serious writer.

I've been reading Gertrude Stein's work more carefully lately, trying to understand what she's attempting with language. Her experiments with repetition and rhythm seem excessive at first, but there's something underneath that connects with what I'm trying to do in my own very different way - the search for a more direct, honest way of putting experience into words.

The boxing lessons I've been taking have taught me something unexpected about writing. Both require absolute honesty about your own capabilities and weaknesses. In the ring, you can't pretend to have skills you lack - you'll be exposed immediately. The same is true with writing. Every false note, every attempt to sound like someone else, every evasion of difficult truth shows up on the page for anyone with experience to see.

I'm enclosing a story I finished last week - "A Farewell to Arms" - not the novel but a short piece with the same title. I'd value your opinion on whether it works. I've been trying to develop a style that carries maximum emotional impact through understatement and implication rather than direct statement. Whether this succeeds depends partly on the reader's willingness to participate actively in the creation of meaning.

The question of what American literature should be in this post-war period occupies many of our conversations here. We can't continue writing as if the 19th century never ended, but we also can't abandon everything valuable from our literary tradition. The challenge is finding a voice that's authentically American but sophisticated enough to engage with the complexity of modern experience.

Your portrayal of Gatsby himself impressed me particularly because you managed to make him both ridiculous and noble simultaneously. That kind of complex characterization is what American literature needs - people who aren't simply good or bad but contain the contradictions that make human beings interesting and unpredictable.

I've been experimenting with dialogue that sounds completely natural but is actually carefully constructed to reveal character and advance the story simultaneously. Real conversation is usually boring and repetitive, but fictional dialogue must seem real while being much more efficient and purposeful. The art lies in making the artificial seem natural.

The expatriate life here provides constant material for observation, but I'm conscious that we risk becoming permanent outsiders, belonging fully neither to Europe nor to America. The danger is that our writing might become too detached from the immediate reality of American life. Yet the perspective we gain from distance seems essential to understanding what we're really writing about.

Ezra Pound continues to be generous with advice and introductions, though his theories about poetry sometimes seem more complex than the actual poems require. His insistence on precision and economy of language aligns with my own instincts, even when his classical references leave me feeling inadequately educated.

I hope you're finding time for your own writing despite the social demands that success brings. The work itself must remain the center - everything else, including recognition and financial reward, should serve the primary purpose of creating lasting literature. We're still young enough to write the books that will matter decades from now, but only if we protect the integrity of our artistic vision.

The cafés here provide the perfect environment for writing - public enough to prevent the isolation that can breed self-consciousness, but anonymous enough to allow complete concentration on the work. I've written some of my best passages surrounded by conversations in three languages, somehow finding focus within the gentle chaos of Parisian café life.

Please give my regards to Zelda and let me know when you might visit Paris again. The literary community here would benefit from your presence, and I selfishly want the opportunity to discuss writing with someone who understands both the craft and the peculiar pressures of trying to be an American artist in this strange post-war world.

Ernest

P.S. - I'm planning a trip to Spain next spring for the running of the bulls in Pamplona. The combination of ritual, danger, and authentic tradition provides exactly the kind of material I'm trying to capture in my work. You should consider joining us if your schedule permits.
