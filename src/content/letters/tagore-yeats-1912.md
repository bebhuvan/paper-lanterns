My dear Yeats,

I am glad that you have found some beauty in my translations. I know they are not poetry in the true sense of the word, but they may serve as a bridge between two literatures.

When I translate my Bengali poems into English, I feel like a musician trying to play a violin piece on a flute. The melody remains, but the timbre is entirely different. Yet perhaps this very difference may bring something new to English readers.

You have been most kind in your encouragement, and I am grateful for your willingness to write an introduction to my little book. Your words will carry far more weight with English readers than mine ever could.

I have been thinking much about the nature of translation during my stay in London. Is it possible to truly convey the spirit of one language in another? Or do we inevitably create something new, neither fully Eastern nor Western, but partaking of both?

My Bengali readers know these poems in their original dress of rhythm and rhyme. To them, the poems are inseparable from their music. But perhaps in losing their original music, they may gain something else - a more direct access to their meaning.

I am curious to see how English readers will receive these offerings from a distant land. Will they find in them something universal, or will they remain forever foreign?

Your friendship has meant much to me during these months in London. To find a kindred spirit across such vast differences of culture and tradition gives me hope that poetry may indeed be a universal language.

With deep gratitude and warm regards,

Rabindranath Tagore
