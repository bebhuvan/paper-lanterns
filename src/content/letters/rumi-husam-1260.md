The beloved is in your longing for Him, not in your seeking. He is closer to you than your jugular vein, yet you search for Him in the far corners of the earth. Turn inward, dear friend, for the treasure you seek lies buried in the field of your own heart.

My dear Husam, your letter asking about the nature of divine love has reached me during the season of renewal, when the earth awakens from winter's sleep and reminds us that death and rebirth are one continuous dance. How fitting that you should ask about love now, when every flower is a prayer and every bird a mystic lost in ecstasy.

You write that you feel far from God, that your prayers seem to echo in emptiness, that the divine presence feels like a rumor rather than a reality. But oh, my friend, what you call distance is actually intimacy! What you experience as absence is the most exquisite presence. The beloved hides in your very seeking for Him.

Consider the reed torn from the reed bed—this is the image that haunts my poems. The reed's plaintive song is born from its separation, its wound becomes its music. Your longing, your sense of spiritual homelessness, this too is sacred music. The beloved is not somewhere else, waiting to be found. The beloved is the very longing itself, the ache that drives you to seek, the emptiness that makes space for fullness.

I have been a student of love for many years now, ever since my heart was shattered and remade by my encounter with Shams-i-Tabrizi. That wild dervish taught me that the path to God is not through the mind but through the heart set on fire. When you love truly—whether a person, a sunset, a line of poetry, or the divine itself—you are touching the same eternal source.

The Christians have their Christ, the Jews their Torah, the Muslims their Quran. But love—ah, love is the religion that transcends all religions, the mosque and temple and church that needs no building. In love, the Catholic and the Sufi dance together, the Buddhist and the Brahmin share the same wine of ecstasy.

Do not think that I speak against the forms of faith—the prayers, the rituals, the sacred books. These are like cups that hold the wine. But do not mistake the cup for what it contains. The wine of divine love pours equally into all vessels, transforms equally all who drink it.

You ask about the whirling that we practice in our gatherings. When we spin, we become like the planets circling the sun, like the atoms dancing in their invisible orbits. The body learns what the mind cannot grasp—that all existence is movement toward the beloved, that even stillness is a form of dance.

But you need not whirl to know this truth, dear Husam. Watch how the lover cannot sit still when thinking of the beloved. Watch how the heart beats faster at the mention of the name that makes it tremble. The whole universe is lovesick, and you are part of that cosmic romance.

I see you struggling with questions of orthodoxy, worried that your mystical experiences might lead you away from the straight path of faith. Let me ease your mind: there is no contradiction between loving God and being drunk with that love. The prophets themselves were intoxicated with the divine presence. Moses could not bear to look upon the burning bush directly; Muhammad wept with longing in his night vigils.

The path of love requires a different kind of death—not the death of the body, but the death of the ego that insists on separation. When you die to yourself, you discover that you were never separate from the beloved at all. The wave realizes it was always ocean.

Keep writing to me of your spiritual journey, my friend. In sharing your questions and struggles, you help me remember my own. We are all students in the school of love, and the curriculum is written in the language of longing.

May your heart remain restless until it rests in the one for whom it was created.
