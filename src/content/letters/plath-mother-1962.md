I am writing the best poems of my life; they will make my name. I am writing them at dawn, in the blue hour before the children wake, and they are coming so fast I can barely keep up.

Mother, I know you worry about me here alone with the children, but you must understand — this separation has freed something in me that I didn't even know was caged. The poems are pouring out of me like water from a broken dam. Dark poems, angry poems, but true ones. Finally, finally true.

Frieda is walking everywhere now, getting into everything, and Nicholas is such a good baby, sleeping through the night most of the time. I get up at 4 AM and write until they wake. Those two hours are mine, completely mine, and in them I am more myself than I have ever been.

The house is cold — so cold I can see my breath as I write — but something about the chill sharpens my mind. I write wearing mittens, stopping only to flex my fingers. Yesterday I finished a poem about Daddy that I think is the best thing I've ever written. It frightened me, how much anger came out on the page.

I know the poems are good, Mother. I can feel their power. They're not like anything I've written before — they're raw and immediate and alive. The editor at The New Yorker won't know what hit him.

Don't worry about me. I am finally becoming who I was always meant to be. The poems know where they want to go; I just have to follow.
