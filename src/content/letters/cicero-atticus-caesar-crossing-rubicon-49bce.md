My Dear Atticus,

The die is cast. Caesar has crossed the Rubicon with his army, and now we must all choose our path in this storm that threatens to destroy our Republic. I write to you from Formiae in the greatest agitation of mind, for I see no course that does not lead to disaster.

What manner of man is this Caesar that he dares bring war upon his own country? He who was given every honor Rome could bestow—consulship, triumph, wealth beyond measure—now turns his legions against the very city that raised him up. The gods themselves must weep to see such ingratitude.

And yet, my dear friend, I confess to you what I dare not say to others: I fear that Caesar may prove victorious. His soldiers are veterans of Gaul, hardened by eight years of conquest, devoted to their general with a loyalty that borders on worship. They follow him not for Rome, but for Caesar alone. What manner of republic is this, where citizens owe their allegiance to a man rather than to the state?

Pompey, meanwhile, seems caught off guard by Caesar's audacity. Our great Pompey, who conquered the East and earned the title Magnus, appears irresolute in this crisis. He speaks of strategic withdrawal, of gathering forces in the East, but I see in his eyes the same uncertainty that plagues us all. Can the hero of so many battles truly be afraid of his former ally?

The Senate has fled Rome like frightened birds before a storm. Our noble conscript fathers, who claim to defend the Republic, have abandoned the very city they swore to protect. How can we speak of preserving Roman liberty when we ourselves run from the enemy? Yet what choice do we have? To remain would be to fall into Caesar's hands, and we all know his mercy extends only as far as his advantage.

I am torn, Atticus, as I have never been torn before. My principles demand that I support the lawful authority of the Senate and People of Rome against this usurper. But my practical mind whispers that Caesar is likely to win, and that those who oppose him now will pay dearly later. Is it honor to choose the losing side, or is it merely foolish pride?

Caesar has written to me personally, urging me to remain neutral, promising that he seeks only his rightful place in the Republic. His words are honeyed, but I have seen too much of politics to trust such promises. Today he offers partnership; tomorrow, when he no longer needs me, what then? Yet if I join Pompey and we lose, will Caesar's mercy extend to one who helped write the very speeches that once condemned his ambitions?

The common people of Rome seem almost to welcome Caesar's approach. They remember his games, his largess, his construction projects that gave them work. To them, he is not a destroyer of the Republic but a generous patron who provides what the aristocrats would hoard. How twisted have we become when a would-be tyrant is seen as the people's champion?

I think often of our ancestors who built this Republic with their blood and virtue. What would Brutus the Liberator say if he could see us now? What would Cato the Censor think of senators who flee rather than face an enemy? Have we grown so soft in our luxury that we have forgotten what it means to be Roman?

Yet perhaps I am too harsh. Perhaps this is simply the natural course of things—republics rise and fall like the tides, and ours has had a longer run than most. Athens fell to Philip, Carthage to us, and now perhaps Rome falls to Caesar. The world will not end, though our world may.

But I refuse to surrender hope entirely. Even if Caesar triumphs, even if he makes himself king in all but name, the idea of the Republic will survive. Men will remember what we fought for, even if we lose. They will remember that some Romans, at least, preferred liberty to servitude, principle to profit.

I must decide soon whether to join Pompey or remain neutral. Each choice carries its own perils, its own potential for honor or disgrace. Pray for me, dear friend, that I may choose wisely, or at least that I may choose in a manner worthy of our friendship and our shared love of Rome.

The Republic may be dying, but while breath remains in my body, I will not let it die without at least one voice raised in its defense.

Your devoted friend, even in these dark times,

Cicero
