about:
  context: "The Gettysburg Address was delivered on November 19, 1863, during the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The cemetery was created to honor Union soldiers killed at the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1-3, 1863), one of the bloodiest battles of the American Civil War. Lincoln was invited to deliver 'a few appropriate remarks' following the main speaker, Edward Everett, who spoke for two hours."
  significance: "Though lasting only about two minutes, the Gettysburg Address is considered one of the greatest speeches in American history. Lincoln redefined the Civil War not merely as a struggle for union, but as a fight for the principles of human equality and democracy. The speech transformed a battlefield dedication into a national rededication to the founding principles of liberty and equality. Its closing phrase about 'government of the people, by the people, for the people' became a defining statement of democratic ideals."
  author_bio: "Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) served as the 16th President of the United States from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. Born into poverty in a Kentucky log cabin, Lincoln was largely self-educated and became a lawyer, Illinois state legislator, and congressman before being elected president. He led the nation through the American Civil War, defending the constitutional union against the Confederate states. Lincoln is remembered for his leadership during the war, his eloquent speeches and writings, and his efforts to abolish slavery."
  occasion_info: "The ceremony was held to dedicate 17 acres of the Gettysburg battlefield as a national cemetery. The battle had claimed over 50,000 casualties from both sides, making it the war's bloodiest single engagement. Lincoln was not the featured speaker - that honor went to Edward Everett, a renowned orator. Lincoln's brief remarks were intended as a ceremonial afterthought, but his concise, powerful words overshadowed the day's main address."

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.

It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
