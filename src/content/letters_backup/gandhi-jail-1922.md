My dear co-workers in the Ashram,

I write to you from my cell in Yeravda Prison, where the walls may confine my body but cannot imprison the truth we serve together. The judge who sentenced me spoke of sedition, but I prefer to think of our work as devotion - devotion to truth, to justice, and to the welfare of our motherland and all humanity.

Even if the Government had the right to imprison me, I have the right to tell them that their action is wrong and that I do not submit to it mentally. Physical force can compel outward compliance, but the soul remains free to choose its allegiance. In this small cell, I am perhaps freer than many who walk in the open air but remain slaves to fear or material desire.

The conditions here are tolerable, though simple. I rise before dawn for prayer and meditation, as has always been my practice. The silence of early morning in prison carries a special quality - undisturbed by the usual sounds of ashram life, it allows for deeper contemplation of our path and purpose. I spend these quiet hours reading the Gita and reflecting on its eternal teachings about duty and detachment.

My daily routine includes spinning on the charkha they have permitted me to keep. Each turn of the wheel reminds me of our connection to the millions of India's poor, for whom this simple tool represents dignity and self-reliance. In the rhythm of spinning, I find both peace and purpose. The thread that emerges symbolizes the delicate but strong bonds that unite all who struggle for justice.

I want you to know that imprisonment has only strengthened my conviction that our path of non-violence is correct. Violence may achieve temporary victories, but only truth and love can create lasting change. The British Empire rests ultimately on the consent of the governed - withdraw that consent through non-cooperation, and even the mightiest empire must bend to justice.

Continue the work of the ashram in my absence, but remember that external activities must spring from inner transformation. We cannot purify the nation until we purify ourselves. Each morning, examine your hearts for traces of hatred, anger, or desire for revenge. These poisons will corrupt our movement more surely than any external opposition.

The spinning program must continue throughout the villages. It represents more than economic self-sufficiency - it embodies the principle that swaraj (self-rule) begins with self-reliance. When every Indian can clothe themselves through their own labor, we will have taken a crucial step toward independence. More importantly, we will have demonstrated that dignity comes from honest work, not from dependence on others.

I have been reflecting deeply on the concept of suffering as purification. Each day in prison, each sacrifice made for the cause of truth, burns away some impurity from our souls and from the collective soul of our movement. We must welcome suffering not as victims but as voluntary participants in the great work of transformation.

The young people who have left their studies to join our movement trouble some of our critics. They ask how we can encourage students to abandon their education. But what education is more valuable than learning to stand for truth? What knowledge is more precious than understanding that some things are worth any sacrifice?

Yet I want our young friends to remember that civil disobedience is not mere rebellion against authority. It is a disciplined response to unjust laws, undertaken only after careful consideration and with willingness to accept the consequences. The civil resister breaks unjust laws openly, gladly accepting imprisonment as the price of keeping faith with conscience.

The hartals and boycotts must continue, but always in a spirit of love rather than hatred. We oppose British policies, not British people. We resist an unjust system, not those trapped within it. Our goal is not to humiliate our opponents but to appeal to the humanity that exists within every heart, even the hardest.

I am particularly concerned that our movement maintain its commitment to Hindu-Muslim unity. Some try to exploit our struggle to deepen communal divisions, but we must resist such temptations. Our fight is for justice, which knows no religious boundaries. Hindu and Muslim, Sikh and Christian, Parsi and Buddhist - all who love truth and justice are our brothers and sisters in this struggle.

The economic boycott of foreign cloth has been remarkably successful, but remember its deeper purpose. We seek not merely to damage British trade but to revive Indian industry and craftsmanship. Every yard of khadi we weave, every spinning wheel we operate, every foreign garment we refuse to buy is a vote for Indian self-reliance and dignity.

Women have shown extraordinary courage in our movement, often surpassing men in their dedication to the cause. Encourage our sisters to continue their participation, for independence achieved without women's equal contribution would be incomplete. The future India we envision must offer full dignity and opportunity to all its children, regardless of gender.

The question of untouchability weighs heavily on my mind as I contemplate our struggle for freedom. How can we claim the right to self-rule while denying basic human dignity to millions of our own people? The fight against untouchability is not separate from our political struggle - it is central to it. We cannot build a just society on a foundation of injustice.

Village reconstruction remains crucial to our long-term goals. Political independence without economic and social transformation would leave the vast majority of Indians little better than before. Every village that adopts spinning, every community that overcomes the poison of untouchability, every school that teaches both knowledge and character - these are the building blocks of true swaraj.

I spend considerable time each day in prayer, not only for our movement but for our opponents. The British officials who implement unjust policies are also trapped by a system that corrupts both ruler and ruled. Our non-violence seeks to break these chains of mutual degradation, freeing both oppressor and oppressed.

The international attention our movement has attracted brings both opportunity and responsibility. People around the world watch to see whether non-violence can achieve what violence has failed to accomplish. We carry not only the hopes of India but the hopes of all who dream of justice without bloodshed.

Some ask whether I feel lonely or discouraged in prison. The truth is that I have never felt more connected to our cause or more optimistic about its ultimate success. Every day brings reports of new participants in our movement, new villages joining the boycott, new young people willing to sacrifice comfort for principle. How can one feel lonely when surrounded by such dedication?

The reading I am permitted includes works of history and philosophy that help me understand our struggle in a broader context. Every great movement for human dignity has faced similar challenges, similar opposition from entrenched power. Yet truth has a persistence that outlasts all temporary defeats. What seems impossible today becomes inevitable tomorrow.

I want you to continue the educational work among children, teaching them not only reading and writing but the values of truth, non-violence, and service. The India we are fighting for will be shaped by today's children. If we can instill in them a love of justice and a commitment to non-violence, we will have secured victory for generations to come.

The agricultural experiments at the ashram should continue, developing methods that increase production while remaining environmentally sustainable. Independence will mean little to the hungry peasant unless we can also show him how to feed his family through improved farming techniques. Self-rule must include the ability to feed ourselves.

Personal cleanliness and community hygiene remain important aspects of our work. A movement for national purification must begin with attention to the most basic aspects of daily life. Clean bodies, clean homes, clean villages - these reflect the inner purity we seek to achieve through our struggle.

I close this letter with a request that you pray not only for our success but for our continued faithfulness to the principles that guide us. Victory achieved through compromise with evil would be worse than honest defeat. Let us win only in ways that leave us worthy of victory.

The path ahead remains long and difficult, but each day brings us closer to the dawn of freedom. Hold fast to truth, practice non-violence not as mere strategy but as a way of life, and remember always that we fight not against people but against the forces of injustice that diminish all humanity.

Your fellow servant in the cause of truth and justice,

M. K. Gandhi

P.S. - Please ensure that the accounts of ashram expenses are maintained with complete transparency. Public trust is our most precious asset, and it can only be preserved through absolute honesty in all our dealings.
