All changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born. I write to you now from a Dublin transformed by sacrifice and blood. The men I knew as dreamers have become martyrs, and their deaths have transfigured not only themselves but all of Ireland.

My dear Æ, when I passed by the Post Office yesterday, I could hardly recognize the street where we have walked so many times discussing poetry and the mystical traditions of our ancient land. The stones are still blackened, the windows boarded up, and in the air there lingers something I can only call the scent of history—acrid, terrible, and strangely exhilarating.

I have been writing, trying to capture what happened here, but words seem inadequate to the enormity of it all. MacDonagh and MacBride, Connolly and Pearse—men I knew, men whose poetry I criticized, men whose politics sometimes seemed to me too rigid, too uncompromising. Now they are dead, shot in Kilmainham Gaol, and their deaths have made them more powerful than their lives ever could.

This troubles me greatly, my friend. I have always believed in the power of the imagination to transform society, in the ability of poetry and art to change hearts and minds. But here we see the power of blood sacrifice, of martyrdom, of violence transformed into mythology. These men have achieved through death what we have spent decades trying to achieve through words.

I think of Pearse, standing before the firing squad, becoming in that moment not just a failed revolutionary but an eternal symbol of Irish resistance. I think of Connolly, wounded and tied to a chair so they could shoot him, transformed from a labor organizer into a Christ-like figure of suffering and redemption.

Were they right to choose this path? I find myself torn between admiration and horror. They knew, I think, that their rebellion could not succeed militarily. But they also knew that their deaths would accomplish what their lives could not—the awakening of a people, the birth of a new Ireland.

"A terrible beauty is born"—I wrote those words this morning, and they will not leave me alone. Terrible because of the violence, the loss, the way that innocent lives were caught up in the machinery of revolution. Beautiful because of the courage, the idealism, the willingness to die for something greater than oneself.

We poets have always known that beauty and terror are intimately connected, that the sublime moment often comes at the cost of ordinary comfort and safety. But to see it played out in the streets of our own city, to watch men we knew personally transformed into legends before our eyes—this is something different.

Ireland is not the same country it was three weeks ago. The English may think they have crushed the rebellion, but they have only watered the seeds of independence with martyrs' blood. What will grow from this sacrifice, I cannot say, but I know it will be something unprecedented in our long and troubled history.

I must return to my writing. There is a poem demanding to be born from all this chaos and glory.
