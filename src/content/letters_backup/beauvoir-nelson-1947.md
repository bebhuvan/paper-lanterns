One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. And perhaps the same is true of love—we are not born loving, but learn to love through the choices we make and the freedom we claim.

My dearest Nelson, your letter found me in the midst of writing about the ethics of ambiguity, and I cannot help but see our relationship as the perfect embodiment of this philosophical puzzle. We exist in the space between—between commitment and freedom, between love and independence, between the desire to possess and the need to remain authentic.

The world tells us that love requires sacrifice, that to love truly means to surrender one's freedom to another. But this is precisely the kind of false choice that keeps us trapped in inauthentic existence. Why must love diminish us? Why cannot love be an expansion of our freedom rather than its limitation?

When I am with you in Chicago, walking through those snow-covered streets or listening to jazz in the smoky clubs, I feel most myself—not despite our love, but because of it. You do not ask me to be less than I am; you celebrate the woman who writes and thinks and rebels against convention.

This is what authentic love looks like: two freedoms choosing each other, again and again, without the security of possession or the comfort of conventional promises. We cannot know what the future holds, whether our paths will continue to intersect or diverge. What matters is that in this moment, we choose each other with full knowledge of our separate destinies.

The bourgeois world cannot understand such love. They see only scandal in our refusal to marry, only tragedy in our acceptance that love need not last forever to be real and profound. But we know better. We know that love's authenticity lies not in its duration but in its depth, not in its exclusivity but in its intensity.

I think of the women I write about—trapped in lives they never chose, defined entirely by their relationships to men, their own desires and ambitions subsumed into the roles of wife and mother. I refuse such a fate, not because I love you less, but because I love myself enough to remain whole.

This is my gift to you, beloved: not a woman diminished by love, but a woman enlarged by it. And perhaps this is the revolution we represent together—proof that love need not be a prison but can be a liberation, an expansion of what it means to be human.

Come to me as I come to you: free, authentic, and unafraid.
