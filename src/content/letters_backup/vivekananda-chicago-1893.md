My beloved brother Brahmananda,

I write to you with a heart overflowing with emotion and gratitude after the most extraordinary experience of my life. Yesterday, I stood before the World Parliament of Religions here in Chicago and spoke words that I believe may have changed not only my own destiny but perhaps the course of how East and West understand each other.

When I rose to speak, I began simply with "Sisters and Brothers of America," and the entire assembly of thousands rose to their feet in spontaneous applause that lasted for several minutes. In that moment, I felt the presence of our beloved Master, Sri Ramakrishna, guiding my words, and the profound truth of Vedanta flowing through me to these Western hearts hungry for spiritual wisdom.

I fervently hope that the bell that tolled this morning in honor of this convention may be the death-knell of all fanaticism, of all persecutions with the sword or with the pen, and of all uncharitable feelings between persons wending their way to the same goal. The assembled delegates represented every major faith on earth, yet I sensed beneath our surface differences a common yearning for the Divine that transcends all sectarian boundaries.

My message was simple yet, I believe, revolutionary for this gathering: that all religions are but different paths leading to the same summit, that the essence of every faith is the realization of the Divine within, and that what the world needs is not the conversion of one faith to another but the recognition of the truth that underlies all faiths.

I spoke of our ancient teaching "Ekam sat vipra bahudha vadanti" - Truth is one, sages call it by many names. I explained how Hinduism, far from being narrow or exclusive, teaches that every soul is potentially divine and that the goal of life is to manifest this divinity through control of nature, external and internal. This divinity can be realized through work, worship, psychic control, or philosophy - by one or more or all of these - and be free.

The response has been overwhelming. Newspapers are calling me the "cyclonic monk from India," and people are approaching me on the streets asking about Vedanta and yoga. Many Americans, I discover, are spiritually starved by purely materialistic pursuits and are eager to learn about the inner dimensions of existence that our tradition has explored for millennia.

But I must confess, dear brother, that along with elation, I feel a tremendous responsibility. I have opened a door between East and West that cannot be closed again. The ancient wisdom of our sages is now flowing into Western minds, and I pray that I am worthy to be its vessel. I fear making any mistake that might distort or diminish the purity of the teachings that our Master embodied so perfectly.

Yesterday evening, a Christian minister approached me and said, "Swami, you have shown me that my Christ and your Krishna are perhaps the same Divine Light appearing in different forms." A Jewish rabbi told me that my explanation of the Self helped him understand passages in the Kabbalah that had long puzzled him. A Buddhist scholar nodded knowingly when I spoke of the unity of all existence.

This is what gives me the greatest joy - not that I am converting people to Hinduism, but that I am helping them discover the deepest truths within their own traditions. True religion, I am realizing, is not about changing one's external practices but about awakening to the divinity that is our true nature.

I have been invited to tour America and establish centers for the teaching of Vedanta. The opportunities seem limitless, but I constantly remember our Master's words: "Religion is not for empty bellies." I see great poverty and social injustice even in this wealthy nation, and I wonder how to bring not only spiritual wisdom but practical compassion to address human suffering.

The Americans are wonderfully receptive to new ideas, yet I sometimes worry about their tendency to treat spirituality as another commodity to be consumed. How do I share the profound discipline and surrender that true realization requires while speaking to minds accustomed to quick results and instant satisfaction?

I have been studying Western philosophy and science, and I am amazed at the parallels I find with Vedanta. When Darwin writes of evolution, I see our teaching of the gradual manifestation of divinity through countless forms. When their physicists speak of the unity of energy underlying all matter, I hear echoes of "Sarvam khalvidam brahma" - all this is indeed Brahman.

Perhaps this is the work that lies ahead - to build bridges between ancient wisdom and modern knowledge, between Eastern spirituality and Western science, between contemplative traditions and active social reform. The synthesis could produce something beautiful and transformative for all humanity.

I am also beginning to understand that my mission is not one-directional. Yes, I am bringing Eastern wisdom to the West, but I must also take Western achievements back to India. Their mastery of material progress, their spirit of inquiry, their democratic ideals, their emphasis on individual dignity - these too have spiritual value and could help us overcome the social stagnation that has weakened our motherland.

The true Hindu does not reject any truth, regardless of its source. If Western science can help us feed the hungry and heal the sick, if Western education can develop minds capable of both ancient wisdom and modern knowledge, if Western organizational methods can help us serve humanity more effectively, then these become tools for spiritual work.

I dream of an India that combines the spiritual depth of our tradition with the practical effectiveness of Western civilization. Not India imitating the West, but India expressing its own genius in forms that can address modern challenges. Similarly, I dream of a West that finds in Eastern wisdom the spiritual nourishment its material success cannot provide.

The Parliament continues for several more days, and I will speak again on the universality of religion and the practical applications of Vedanta to daily life. But already I sense that this gathering has planted seeds that will grow for generations. Religious dialogue will never be the same. The exclusive claims of any single tradition will be harder to maintain when so many paths to the Divine have been represented with such dignity and wisdom.

Pray for me, dear brother, that I may remain humble before this great responsibility, that I may never forget that I am merely an instrument in the hands of the Divine, that the wisdom I share comes not from my own limited understanding but from the infinite source that our Master revealed to us.

The work ahead seems vast - to establish teaching centers, to write books that make Vedanta accessible to Western minds, to train others who can carry on this mission, to return eventually to India with whatever gifts the West can offer for our nation's upliftment. But I remember the Master's words: "When the time comes, everything will be provided."

I close with a prayer that this Parliament may indeed mark the beginning of a new age of mutual understanding among religions, an age when each tradition contributes its unique gifts to the common human search for truth, beauty, and goodness.

Send my prostrations to the Holy Mother and my love to all our spiritual family. The work of our Master is spreading far beyond what any of us imagined possible.

Your brother in service to the Divine in all beings,

Narendranath (Vivekananda)

P.S. - I am enclosing newspaper clippings of my speeches and the remarkable responses they have generated. Please share them with our brothers at Baranagar Math. They will see that the message of Sri Ramakrishna is finding receptive hearts even in this distant land.
