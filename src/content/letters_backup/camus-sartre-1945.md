There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. Yet I believe we must imagine Sisyphus happy.

My dear Sartre, as I write this letter in the shadow of Hiroshima and the liberation of the camps, I find myself confronting the full weight of human absurdity. We have witnessed the depths of human cruelty and the heights of human sacrifice, often within the same breath, the same moment.

You speak of radical freedom, of the burden of choice that existence places upon us. I do not disagree, but I would add this: we must revolt. Not the revolution of the politicians with their grand schemes and inevitable tyrannies, but the revolt of the individual consciousness against the absurd condition of existence.

The absurd man—and I count myself among them—does not hope. He does not believe in ultimate meaning or divine purpose. Yet he does not despair. Instead, he revolts by living fully, by embracing the very meaninglessness that surrounds him and creating his own values in defiance of the void.

This is what I learned in the Resistance, my friend. Not that we were fighting for some grand cause that history would vindicate, but that we were asserting our humanity in the face of forces that sought to reduce us to things, to objects, to numbers. The act of resistance itself was its own justification.

I think of Sisyphus, eternally pushing his boulder up the mountain, knowing it will roll down again. The gods thought this the most dreadful punishment—futile and hopeless labor. But I see something else: the moment when Sisyphus walks back down the mountain, superior to his fate, stronger than his rock.

In that descent, Sisyphus is free. He has accepted the absurdity of his condition, yet he continues. He does not hope for reprieve or meaning, yet he does not surrender. He is fully alive in his revolt against the absurd.

This, I believe, is our task as writers and thinkers in this post-war world. Not to offer false hope or manufactured meaning, but to show that revolt itself—the simple affirmation of human dignity in the face of absurdity—is enough. More than enough. It is everything.

The question is not whether life has meaning, but whether we have the courage to live without meaning and still say yes to life.
