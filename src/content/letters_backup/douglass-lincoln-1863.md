Your Excellency,

I address you today not only as a citizen deeply concerned about the conduct of this great war, but as one who has witnessed firsthand the courage and determination of colored soldiers in the service of their country. The matters I bring to your attention require immediate action if we are to fulfill the promise of freedom and equality that this conflict has awakened in the hearts of four million enslaved Americans.

When first the rebel cannon shattered the walls of Sumter and woke the attending genius of revolution, I said, the slaveholders have done it at last. They have exposed the weak point in the American Government, and opened the way for the redemption of four millions of my brethren. The war that began to preserve the Union has become, by the logic of events and the moral pressure of justice, a war for human freedom.

Yet I must speak plainly about the treatment our colored soldiers receive, for it undermines the very principles we claim to defend. These men who have taken up arms for the Union - many of them escaped slaves fighting for their own freedom and that of their families still in bondage - face discrimination that dishonors both them and the cause they serve.

The inequality in pay between white and colored soldiers is not merely an economic injustice but a moral contradiction that weakens our army and betrays our principles. When a colored soldier receives $10 per month while his white comrade receives $13 for the same service, we declare that blood shed for liberty has different values depending on the color of the skin that contains it. This cannot stand in a nation claiming to fight for human equality.

More troubling still is the Confederate declaration that captured colored soldiers will be treated not as prisoners of war but as slaves in rebellion, subject to execution or sale into slavery. Yet our government has not responded with the clear threat of retaliation that would protect these brave men. Every colored soldier who enlists does so knowing that capture means death or a fate worse than death, while the government he serves remains silent about his protection.

I have spoken with many colored soldiers and their families. They ask not for special treatment but for equal treatment. They seek not privileges but rights - the right to receive equal pay for equal service, the right to be promoted based on merit rather than limited by prejudice, the right to be treated as soldiers rather than as a curiosity or experiment.

The performance of colored troops in battle has exceeded even my highest expectations. At Fort Wagner, the 54th Massachusetts demonstrated courage that would have been remarkable in any regiment. At Milliken's Bend, colored soldiers fought with desperate valor to protect the very soil of freedom. At Battery Wagner, Port Hudson, and countless other engagements, they have proven that the desire for liberty makes men fight with superhuman determination.

Yet these same soldiers return to camps where they face insults and discrimination from some of their white officers and comrades. They are assigned disproportionately to manual labor rather than combat roles, as if their willingness to die for the Union somehow makes them suitable only for menial tasks. Such treatment not only wrongs these individual soldiers but also wastes a tremendous resource of military strength.

Mr. President, I have observed that this war has already transformed both you and our nation in ways few could have predicted when it began. The President who initially claimed that saving the Union did not require ending slavery has issued an Emancipation Proclamation that makes freedom the central purpose of our struggle. The nation that once compromised with slavery now fights to destroy it completely.

I believe you have the wisdom to see that full equality for colored soldiers is not merely a matter of justice - though justice alone would be sufficient reason - but also a matter of practical necessity. We cannot ask men to fight for a freedom they are not allowed to fully enjoy. We cannot expect loyalty from those who are treated as second-class members of the very army they serve.

The colored population of the South watches this war with intense interest. They see in our colored soldiers their own hopes for freedom and equality. When these soldiers are well-treated and successful, it encourages more enslaved people to seek Union lines and contribute to our cause. When they are mistreated or limited by prejudice, it sends a message that perhaps the Union victory would not mean true equality after all.

I urge you to issue clear orders requiring equal pay for equal service regardless of color. I ask you to threaten retaliation against Confederate forces that murder or enslave captured colored soldiers. I request that you encourage the promotion of capable colored soldiers to positions of leadership, demonstrating that merit rather than race determines advancement in the Union Army.

These steps would not only serve justice but would also strengthen our military position. Nothing would encourage Confederate slaves to desert their masters and join our forces more effectively than seeing that the Union treats all its soldiers with dignity and fairness. Nothing would improve the morale and effectiveness of colored troops more than knowing their government values their service equally with that of white soldiers.

I am often asked whether I believe this war will truly bring freedom to my people. I answer that the war has already brought freedom to many, but whether that freedom will be complete and permanent depends upon decisions being made now about how we treat those who fight for liberty. The colored soldier who sheds his blood for the Union flag must know that flag will protect him as fully as it protects any other American soldier.

The Constitution you have sworn to preserve and defend declares that no person shall be denied equal protection under the law. Surely this principle applies with special force to those who risk their lives defending that Constitution. The colored soldier who faces Confederate bullets in defense of the Union deserves the full protection and support of the government he serves.

Mr. President, I do not minimize the political difficulties these measures might create. I understand that some in your party fear that full equality for colored soldiers might alienate white voters or create new problems in the post-war period. But I believe history will judge us not by our political calculations but by our fidelity to the principles of justice and human dignity that make this war worth fighting.

The world watches this great experiment in democracy and freedom. European critics who have long predicted that American liberty would prove incompatible with American slavery now wait to see whether we will create a new nation truly founded on the principle that all men are created equal. The treatment of our colored soldiers sends a message to the world about whether American promises of equality are genuine or merely rhetorical.

I close with a personal appeal based on our conversations earlier this year. I saw in your eyes and heard in your voice a genuine commitment to justice that transcends political expedience. You spoke of this war as a test of whether any nation conceived in liberty can long endure. I believe that test cannot be passed unless we prove that liberty belongs fully and equally to all Americans regardless of race.

The colored soldiers who fight under our flag have already proven their worthiness for full citizenship through their courage and sacrifice. Now we must prove our worthiness for their service through our commitment to equality and justice.

Your obedient servant in the cause of justice, liberty, and humanity,

Frederick Douglass

P.S. - I continue to recruit colored soldiers for the Union cause, but each passing day of unequal treatment makes that task more difficult. These men are willing to die for freedom; they ask only to be treated as free men while they live to serve.
