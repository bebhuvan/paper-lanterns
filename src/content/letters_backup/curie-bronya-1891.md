My dearest Bronya,

Your letter brought such warmth to my heart during these cold March days in Paris. How good it is to know that someone in this vast city truly cares about my welfare! I read your words over and over, drawing strength from your encouragement and your own example of perseverance.

Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We have the right to believe that we have a gift for something, and that this thing, at whatever cost, must be attained. Your sacrifice in working as a governess to support my education here continues to humble and inspire me. I am determined to prove worthy of such sisterly devotion.

My studies at the Sorbonne progress well, though the work grows more challenging each day. Professor Lippmann's physics lectures are absolutely fascinating - he demonstrates phenomena I had only read about in textbooks back in Warsaw. Yesterday he showed us experiments with electrical discharges that made the very air glow with mysterious light. In those moments I feel I am witnessing the secrets of nature herself being revealed.

The mathematics is perhaps the most demanding aspect of my coursework. I spend hours each evening working through problems in differential calculus and mathematical analysis. My cramped little room becomes a laboratory of numbers and equations, covered with sheets of calculations. Sometimes I work so late that the candle burns down to nothing, leaving me to continue by moonlight streaming through the window.

You ask about my living conditions, and I must be honest - they are quite spartan. The sixth-floor room I rent costs forty francs a month, leaving little for food or fuel. Most days I subsist on bread and butter, occasionally supplemented with an egg or a piece of chocolate when I can afford such luxuries. The cold is perhaps harder to bear than hunger; some mornings I wake to find ice in the washbasin.

But please do not worry about me! These hardships seem small compared to the incredible privilege of studying science at one of the world's great universities. When I sit in the amphitheater listening to lectures on physics or chemistry, surrounded by the accumulated wisdom of centuries, I feel richer than any empress. Knowledge is wealth that no one can steal or diminish by sharing.

My fellow students remain somewhat distant. Being both foreign and female makes me an oddity in their eyes. The French students are polite but formal, while the few other foreign students seem to band together by nationality. I have learned to be content with solitude, using the extra time for additional study rather than social conversation.

Professor Gabriel Lippmann has been particularly encouraging about my work in physics. After my recent examination, he commented that my approach to problems shows unusual insight. Such praise from a scientist of his caliber means more to me than all the social acceptance in the world. He has suggested that I consider advanced research after completing my degree - an idea that fills me with both excitement and trepidation.

The laboratory work fascinates me most of all. There is something almost magical about manipulating the physical world to reveal its secrets. Last week I spent hours measuring the magnetic properties of different materials, watching how they responded to electrical currents. Each measurement brought new questions, each answer revealed deeper mysteries.

I dream sometimes of making discoveries that would advance human knowledge, of finding new elements or uncovering unknown physical laws. Is such ambition unseemly in a woman? Perhaps, but I cannot help believing that the pursuit of truth recognizes no gender. Nature keeps her secrets equally from men and women - and perhaps yields them equally to those with sufficient determination and skill.

Your letters from home bring mixed emotions. How I long to see the familiar streets of Warsaw, to speak Polish without thinking, to embrace our parents! Yet I know that returning now would mean abandoning everything I have worked toward. The educational opportunities for women in Poland remain so limited compared to what Paris offers. Here, at least, I can attend lectures and work in laboratories alongside the best scientific minds of our time.

Father's last letter mentioned his pride in my academic progress, though I sense he still worries about the unconventional path I have chosen. A secure teaching position in Warsaw would certainly be more practical than these uncertain pursuits in physics research. Yet I cannot shake the conviction that I am meant for something more significant than routine instruction in elementary science.

The spring weather brings renewed energy and optimism. After months of gray skies and bitter winds, the sight of budding trees along the Boulevard Saint-Michel feels like a promise of better days ahead. I walk to the university each morning with lighter steps, breathing air that finally carries hints of warmth and renewal.

My French continues to improve, though I still struggle with some technical terminology in my advanced courses. It is strange to think in a foreign language about concepts that challenge understanding in any tongue! Sometimes I find myself translating complex ideas back into Polish or German to fully grasp their meaning before attempting to work with them in French.

The library at the Sorbonne has become my second home. I arrive early to claim a seat by the tall windows where natural light lasts longest into the evening. Surrounded by towers of scientific journals and textbooks, I lose myself in reading about the latest discoveries in physics and chemistry. The work being done by scientists across Europe astounds me - we truly live in an age of unprecedented scientific progress.

I have been following with particular interest the research on electrical phenomena in gases. Professor Crookes in England has developed remarkable tubes that produce streams of particles when electricity passes through near-vacuum conditions. Such experiments suggest that matter itself may be composed of smaller, invisible particles - an idea that revolutionizes everything we thought we knew about the fundamental nature of reality.

Your encouragement to maintain correspondence with other Polish students studying abroad has proven valuable. Through letters with fellow countrymen in Berlin and Vienna, I keep abreast of scientific developments across Europe. We share information about new theories, experimental techniques, and career opportunities. Such networks may prove crucial for future research collaborations.

The question of what comes after my degree completion grows more pressing as the months pass. Professor Lippmann has hinted at possibilities for advanced research positions, though such opportunities for women remain rare and competitive. I must prepare thoroughly for any examinations or interviews that might determine my future in science.

Money remains a constant concern, but I have learned to be remarkably economical. A few francs can last several days if spent carefully on bread, milk, and coal for the tiny stove. I have even learned to enjoy the simple pleasure of hot tea after long hours of study in the cold room. Luxury, I discover, is largely a matter of perspective and expectation.

My health generally remains good despite the challenging living conditions. The long walks between my lodging and the university provide necessary exercise, while the mental stimulation of my studies energizes me in ways that adequate food or warmth never could. There is truth in the old saying that we can live on ideas as much as on bread - though both together would certainly be preferable!

Sometimes in the evening, when the day's work is finished and my room falls silent except for sounds from the street below, I reflect on the remarkable journey that brought me to Paris. From a young girl in Warsaw dreaming of scientific education to a student at one of Europe's greatest universities - the transformation still amazes me. Your support made this miracle possible.

I want you to know that every sacrifice you made to help fund my education has been put to the very best use. Not a single franc has been wasted on frivolous pursuits or unnecessary comforts. Every coin has gone toward advancing my scientific knowledge and bringing me closer to meaningful research contributions.

The approaching examinations fill me with both anxiety and anticipation. So much depends on demonstrating mastery of the complex material we have covered this year. Yet I feel well-prepared through months of intensive study and laboratory work. Whatever the outcome, I will know that I gave my absolute best effort to this unprecedented opportunity.

My dear sister, I close this long letter with renewed gratitude for your unwavering support and love. The bonds between us grow stronger rather than weaker across the miles and months of separation. Your faith in my abilities sustains me through the most difficult moments of doubt or discouragement.

When we meet again - and that day will come! - I hope to share with you discoveries and achievements that justify the confidence you have shown in my dreams. Until then, know that your devoted sister works each day to honor the gift of education you helped make possible.

Your loving and grateful sister,

Manya

P.S. - I have enclosed a small pressed flower from the Luxembourg Gardens, where I sometimes walk on Sunday afternoons to clear my mind between weeks of intensive study. Consider it a token of the beauty that still flourishes even in the midst of academic struggles.
