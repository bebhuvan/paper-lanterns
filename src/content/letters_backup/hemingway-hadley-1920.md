I love you and I always will and I am sorry. What a useless dirty lousy word 'sorry' is. I love you and I always will. I am writing this late at night and my hand is unsteady.

Hash, I want to marry you. I want to marry you so much it hurts. When I think of you I get a terrible longing that goes right through me. I think about you all day and I dream about you at night.

I keep thinking about that afternoon in Oak Park when we walked by the river and you said you loved me too. I keep hearing your voice saying it over and over. It's the most beautiful sound I've ever heard.

I know I'm not much right now. I'm just a guy trying to be a writer, living in a crummy apartment, making practically no money. But I'm going to be something, Hash. I'm going to write stories that matter, stories that will last. And I want you beside me when I do it.

You make me want to write better. When I think about you reading something I've written, I want every word to be perfect. You make me want to be a better man, a better writer, better at everything.

I dream about us having a little apartment somewhere, maybe in Paris. I'll write in the mornings and we'll walk along the Seine in the evenings. We'll drink wine and talk about books and you'll tell me when my writing is good and when it's terrible, and I'll listen because you're the only person whose opinion I trust completely.

Say you'll marry me, Hash. Say you'll take a chance on a crazy guy who thinks he can write.
