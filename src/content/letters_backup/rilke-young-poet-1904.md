My dear friend,

You write to me about love, and I sense in your words both longing and confusion - the eternal human predicament of wanting connection while fearing the vulnerability it demands. Let me share with you what years of solitude and observation have taught me about this most mysterious of human experiences.

Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. What we call love is often our fear of being alone, our need to possess and be possessed, our desire to lose ourselves in another rather than find ourselves more completely. But true love - ah, that is something entirely different.

Love consists in this: that two solitudes protect and border and greet each other. The point of marriage and partnership is not to create a quick fix for loneliness or to merge two incomplete people into one whole. Rather, it is for two complete beings to stand side by side, each maintaining their individual mystery while choosing to share the journey.

I have watched so many people rush toward love as if it were a refuge from the difficult work of becoming themselves. They mistake intensity for depth, possession for devotion, need for affection. They seek in another what they have not yet cultivated within themselves - wholeness, peace, purpose, joy. But how can someone give you what they do not have? How can you truly love another when you have not learned to love your own solitude?

The work of loving begins not with finding the right person, but with becoming the right person - someone capable of solitude without loneliness, someone who has faced their own darkness and made peace with their contradictions, someone who can offer presence rather than need, strength rather than weakness.

This is why I counsel you to embrace your aloneness, not as exile but as opportunity. In solitude, we discover who we are when stripped of others' expectations and projections. We learn to entertain ourselves, to enjoy our own company, to find fulfillment in simple existence. Only from this foundation can we offer genuine love rather than disguised self-interest.

Watch how nature loves - the way rivers flow toward the sea not from desperation but from inherent direction, the way flowers open to sun not from neediness but from their essential nature responding to what nourishes them. There is no grasping in such love, no fear of loss, no attempt to control or possess. There is only the natural movement toward what enhances life.

When you do encounter love - and you will, though perhaps not in the form you expect - do not try to solve or save or complete your beloved. Do not make them responsible for your happiness or blame them for your sorrows. Instead, love them as you would love a sunset or a piece of music - with appreciation for their beauty, gratitude for the gift of witnessing them, and no desire to possess or change them.

The future enters into us in this way, long before it happens, to transform us from within. Love is not an emotion but a way of being in the world - with openness, with reverence, with willingness to be changed by beauty wherever we encounter it. Sometimes this beauty appears in another person, but just as often it appears in solitude, in nature, in art, in the simple miracle of being alive.

I encourage you to love your questions themselves, including your questions about love. Do not seek answers that will close off mystery but rather cultivate the patience to live your way into understanding. Each relationship - whether romantic, platonic, or even your relationship with yourself - is a teacher offering lessons in how to be human.

The person you are meant to love may not arrive until you have learned to love properly - with your whole being, not just your neediness; with freedom, not just attachment; with celebration, not just possession. This learning happens in solitude as much as in company, through art as much as through romance, through facing your fears as much as through experiencing joy.

Perhaps the greatest love story is not between two people but between a human being and life itself - learning to say yes to existence with all its pain and beauty, learning to trust the process of becoming, learning to find meaning in both connection and separation.

Your experience of longing is not a problem to be solved but an indication of your capacity for love. Let it expand your heart rather than drive you toward premature attachment. Let it teach you about your own depths rather than sending you seeking shallow comfort. Let it prepare you to recognize true love when it appears - love that asks you to grow rather than to diminish, love that celebrates your solitude rather than trying to rescue you from it.

The world needs people who have learned to love well - not just romantically but in the larger sense of approaching existence with reverence, gratitude, and willingness to be transformed by beauty. Begin with loving your own life, your own questions, your own becoming. Everything else will unfold from there.

Your devoted correspondent in the mystery of being human,

Rainer Maria Rilke

P.S. - I am sending you a rose from the garden here at Borgeby. Its brief blooming reminds me that love, like beauty, is most precious precisely because it is transient. We do not possess the rose by picking it; we honor it by allowing it to be itself, even as it fades. So too with all forms of love.
