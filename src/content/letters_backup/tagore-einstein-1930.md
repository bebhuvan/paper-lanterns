I was discussing with Dr. Mendel today the new mathematical discoveries which tell us that in the realm of infinitesimal atoms, chance has its play; the drama of existence is not absolutely predetermined in every detail.

This fact comes very much to my own way of thinking. For I have always felt that in the real world itself, the world of human experience, the world of art and beauty, the world of our moral and spiritual life, there are always the elements of the contingent and the unpredictable.

The question which is of such interest to me is this: Is the world independent of our consciousness? I have been inclined to think that the world which is meaningful to us as human beings is not independent of our consciousness. When I speak of the real world, I do not mean the world of abstract science, but the world as it appears to human consciousness with all its qualities of beauty, truth, and moral significance.

But you, I know, hold that there is a world of objective reality which exists quite apart from us and our knowledge of it. I am eager to know how you reconcile this view with the wonderful discoveries that modern physics has made about the fundamental nature of matter and energy.
