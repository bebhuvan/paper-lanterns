about:
  context: "This letter was written to Mary's younger sister Everina while Mary was working as a governess and beginning to develop her revolutionary ideas about women's education and rights. She was encouraging Everina to become a teacher, seeing education as one of the few paths to independence for women in the 18th century."
  significance: "This personal letter reveals the intimate origins of Wollstonecraft's feminist philosophy. Written five years before 'A Vindication of the Rights of Woman,' it shows her developing thoughts on women's education, economic independence, and the systemic injustices that kept women dependent. The letter demonstrates how her personal struggles informed her political philosophy."
  author_bio: "Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) was a pioneering feminist writer and philosopher. Born into an abusive household, she experienced firsthand the vulnerabilities of women in 18th-century society. Her 'A Vindication of the Rights of Woman' (1792) argued for equal education and opportunities for women. She died shortly after giving birth to her daughter, Mary Shelley, who would later write 'Frankenstein.'"
  recipient_info: "Everina Wollstonecraft (1765-1843) was Mary's younger sister, who followed Mary's advice to become a teacher. She remained unmarried and worked as an educator throughout her life, embodying the independent path her sister advocated for women."

My dear Sister,

It is justice, not charity, that is wanting in the world. We reasonably expect virtue, when we have not given the understanding whereon virtue is built. You ask me about the teaching position, and whether you should accept it. I say yes, with all my heart.

Independence, I have long considered as the grand blessing of life, the basis of every virtue—and independence I will ever secure by contracting my wants, though I were to live on a barren heath. A teacher's life is not easy, but it is honorable, and it is ours by right of our reason, not by sufferance of men's charity.

Women are everywhere in this deplorable state, for in order to preserve their innocence, as ignorance is courteously termed, truth is hidden from them, and they are urged to rely on others for their conduct. Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's scepter, the mind shapes itself to the body and, roaming around its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison.

But you, dear Everina, have the power to break these chains—not just for yourself, but for every young mind you will teach. When we educate a girl, we educate not just her reason, but her capacity for independence. We must not raise women to be merely the satellites of men, revolving around them without light of their own.

I have been thinking much about these matters, and perhaps one day I shall write more extensively on the subject. For now, I press upon you this truth: that until women are more rationally educated, the progress of human virtue and improvement in knowledge must receive continual checks.

Take the position, dear sister. Show the world that a woman can stand alone, can think for herself, can contribute to the great work of human enlightenment. We must be the change we wish to see in this world.

Your affectionate sister,
Mary
