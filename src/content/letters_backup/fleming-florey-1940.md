I am delighted to hear of your success in producing penicillin on a larger scale. What began as an accidental observation in my cluttered laboratory may indeed prove to be one of the most important medical discoveries of our time.

My dear Florey, when I first noticed that mysterious mold killing bacteria in my petri dish twelve years ago, I had no idea we would be corresponding about it during a world war, discussing how it might save the lives of our wounded soldiers.

I must confess that I had nearly given up hope of seeing penicillin become a practical medicine. My own attempts to purify and concentrate it met with limited success, and I began to think it would remain merely a laboratory curiosity—interesting scientifically, but of no practical value.

Your work, and that of Dr. Chain, has proven me wonderfully wrong. The clinical trials you describe are nothing short of miraculous. Infections that would have meant certain death or amputation are now yielding to treatment. It is as if we have been given a magic bullet against the invisible enemies that have plagued humanity since time began.

The irony is not lost on me that this discovery may prove more valuable in wartime than in peace. The very conflict that threatens to destroy civilization may be the catalyst that brings this life-saving medicine to the world. How many young men might return home to their families because of a mold that contaminated my carelessly cleaned laboratory equipment?

I am, as you know, not given to grand pronouncements, but I believe we are witnessing the dawn of a new age in medicine. If penicillin can conquer staphylococcus and streptococcus, what other microbial foes might fall to similar weapons? The systematic search for antibiotics has only just begun.

Please keep me informed of your progress. Though I may have stumbled upon the door, you and your team are the ones with the courage and skill to push it fully open. The world will be forever in your debt.

Time is of the essence now. Every day's delay means lives lost that could have been saved. Press on, my friend—history is watching.
