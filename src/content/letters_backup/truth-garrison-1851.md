If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back, and get it right side up again! And now they is asking to do it, the men better let them.

Dear Mr. Garrison, I write to you from Akron where I have just spoken at the Women's Convention, and I tell you, the Spirit moved me to speak truths that needed speaking. The white ladies there, they was talking about women's rights and suffrage, but they seemed to forget about women like me—women who been working in fields and bearing children and surviving things they can't even imagine.

When that preacher man stood up and said women can't have as many rights as men because Christ wasn't a woman, I had to speak up. I told them: "Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him!" The truth will set us free, Mr. Garrison, but first it's got to be spoken, even when it makes folks uncomfortable.

I been thinking about this question of women's strength. These white ladies, they talk about being delicate, needing protection, can't handle the rough world of politics and business. But look at me! I have plowed and planted and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! I have borne thirteen children and seen most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother's grief, ain't I a woman?

The Lord gave me my name—Sojourner Truth—because I was to travel up and down the land showing the people their sins and being a sign unto them. And the sin I see most clearly is how this nation treats its women, especially its colored women. We ain't just fighting for the vote, Mr. Garrison. We fighting for the right to be seen as human beings.

You know what slavery taught me? It taught me that power ain't about muscle or book learning or money. Power is about spirit. Power is about refusing to let anybody—master, husband, preacher, politician—tell you that you ain't worthy of freedom. I may not be able to read books like these educated ladies, but I can read people, and I can read the will of God.

And God's will is clear: "Male and female created He them." Equal in His sight, equal in their right to freedom, equal in their capacity for wisdom and goodness. When Jesus walked this earth, He talked to women, He learned from women, He let women support His ministry. If Jesus could see women as full human beings, why can't these men in Congress?

I been a slave, Mr. Garrison. I know what it means to have somebody else control your body, your time, your children, your very name. And I'm here to tell you that marriage, the way these men have set it up, ain't so different from slavery for many women. They can't own property, can't vote, can't even keep their own names. Their husbands control them just like masters controlled slaves.

But I also know something else from my years in bondage: the spirit can't be chained. No matter what laws they pass, what restrictions they put on us, the truth is marching on. Women are waking up, colored folks are rising up, and all the king's horses and all the king's men ain't gonna be able to put that old world back together again.

I may be just an old colored woman who talks funny and don't know nothing about fancy politics, but I know this: if God is for us, who can be against us? The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. And justice means freedom for all—not just white men, not just free men, but all of God's children.

Keep printing the truth, Mr. Garrison. Keep making noise. The slaveholders and the woman-holders don't like it, but that just proves we're doing something right. Truth crushed to earth will rise again, and when it does, it's gonna shake the foundations of this whole corrupt system.

The Spirit is moving, brother. Can you feel it?
