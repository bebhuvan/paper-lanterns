about:
  context: "This letter was written at the urging of physicist Leo Szilard and delivered to President Roosevelt on October 11, 1939, by economist Alexander Sachs. It played a crucial role in convincing Roosevelt to begin the research that would eventually become the Manhattan Project."
  significance: "This letter is considered one of the most important scientific letters in history, as it directly led to the United States' development of atomic weapons during World War II. Einstein later called signing this letter the 'one great mistake' of his life."
  author_bio: "Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist widely regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time. He developed the theory of relativity and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. He immigrated to the United States in 1933 to escape Nazi persecution."
  recipient_info: "Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945) was the 32nd President of the United States, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. He led the country through the Great Depression and World War II, implementing the New Deal domestic agenda."

Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration.

I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations:

In the course of the last four months it has been made probable — through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America — that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.

This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable — though much less certain — that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory.

I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsäcker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.
