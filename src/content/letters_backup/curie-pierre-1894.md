Our conversation very soon became friendly. It seemed to me that I had found a brother, someone who understood the scientific life and who could guide me in the path I wanted to follow.

I must tell you how deeply your words yesterday affected me. When you spoke of the beauty hidden in the structure of crystals, of the poetry that exists in the orderly arrangement of atoms, I felt my heart leap. Here at last was someone who could see what I see — that science is not cold calculation, but a profound form of wonder.

You asked about my work on the magnetic properties of steel. I confess, Pierre, that your encouragement means more to me than any recognition from the Academy could. To have found someone who believes not only in my capacity but in my calling — this is a gift I had not dared to hope for.

I have been thinking about what you said regarding the possibility of our working together. The idea fills me with both excitement and trepidation. Could it be possible that two minds, united in purpose, might unlock secrets that neither could discover alone?

There is so much we do not yet understand about the fundamental nature of matter. I dream sometimes of discovering new elements, of peering deeper into the heart of the atom than anyone has dared before. With your knowledge of crystallography and my background in physics, perhaps together we might achieve something truly remarkable.

I hope you will not think me too forward in saying that I believe our meeting was no mere coincidence. In the laboratory of fate, some reactions are inevitable.
