I want to touch people with my art. I want them to say, 'he feels deeply, he feels tenderly'—notwithstanding my so-called roughness, perhaps because of it. What am I in the eyes of most people? A nonentity or an eccentric and disagreeable man.

My dear brother Theo, the sun here in Arles burns with such intensity that I feel I must capture it before it consumes me entirely. I have been painting sunflowers—not just painting them, but trying to express the very essence of their golden fire, their brief and blazing existence under this merciless Provençal sky.

You worry about my health, my sanity, my future. I understand your concerns, dear brother. Sometimes I feel the weight of my own strangeness, my inability to fit into the comfortable world of ordinary people. But I would rather burn out in the pursuit of truth and beauty than live a long, comfortable lie.

The people here think I am mad—this Dutch painter who works with such frenzy, who mixes colors as if possessed, who paints peasants and café terraces and starry nights with equal passion. Perhaps they are right. Perhaps madness is the price one pays for seeing too clearly, for feeling too intensely.

But when I stand before my easel at dawn, watching the light transform the landscape minute by minute, I know I am doing what I was born to do. Each brushstroke is an act of faith, each color choice a prayer. I am trying to paint not just what I see, but what I feel—the throbbing life force that animates everything, from the humblest blade of grass to the most distant star.

I have been reading about the Japanese painters, dear Theo. Their ability to capture the essence of a moment, a season, a feeling with such economy of means—this is what I aspire to. But where they find serenity, I find turbulence. Where they discover balance, I uncover chaos. Perhaps this is my contribution: to show that beauty can exist in disorder, that truth can emerge from torment.

The money you send means more than survival—it means that someone believes in my vision, someone understands that what I am doing matters. When the paint runs low and I must choose between eating and buying pigments, I always choose the pigments. Food sustains the body, but art sustains the soul.

I dream sometimes of a studio of the south, where artists could come to work in this incredible light, to push their vision to its limits under these blazing skies. We could create a new kind of art, one that captures the eternal in the momentary, the universal in the particular.

The locals avoid me now. They whisper about the fou roux—the mad redhead—who paints with such violence and passion. Let them whisper. Someday, perhaps long after I am gone, they will understand what I was trying to show them: that the world is infinitely more beautiful and terrible than they ever imagined, and that it is the artist's sacred duty to bear witness to both its beauty and its terror.

Keep believing in me, dear brother. Your faith is the fuel that keeps my inner fire burning.
