about:
  context: "This extraordinary letter was written by Frederick Douglass to his former slaveholder Thomas Auld, ten years after Douglass had escaped slavery. Published in his own anti-slavery newspaper 'The North Star,' it serves as both a personal reckoning and a powerful indictment of the institution of slavery."
  significance: "This letter represents one of the most powerful first-person testimonies against slavery in American literature. Douglass addresses his former master with dignity and moral authority, transforming from property into a moral equal who can challenge his oppressor directly. It demonstrates the power of literacy and education as tools of liberation."
  author_bio: "Frederick Douglass (c.1818-1895) was born into slavery in Maryland. After escaping to freedom in 1838, he became one of the most influential voices in the abolitionist movement. A gifted orator and writer, he served as advisor to President Lincoln and held several government positions after the Civil War. His autobiographies remain classics of American literature."
  recipient_info: "Thomas Auld was Douglass's final slaveholder in Maryland. After Douglass escaped, Auld continued to legally own him until British supporters purchased Douglass's freedom in 1846. This letter represents Douglass's attempt to appeal to whatever conscience Auld might possess."

I will not undertake to thank you for taking me from my grandmother's hut to your own dwelling, and for giving me linen instead of a coarse tow shirt, "food convenient for me," and the bed and bedding comfortable and warm.

Had you treated me as a nephew, a brother, a son, with tender regard for my well-being, I might have been tempted to think kindly of you. But when I remember that all your kindness to me was your investment in a piece of property; when I remember that while you fed and clothed my body, you starved and kept in midnight darkness my immortal soul—when I remember that you never taught me to read a single letter of the book of life, I am constrained to hate, rather than love you.

You may ask, why do I write to you? You have slumbered on for years over the most cruel wrongs, and your ears are now fortified against any humane appeals on behalf of the enslaved millions. But I write to you for the same reason that the Apostle wrote to the Corinthian church—not because I have hope that you will be converted, but to "stop the mouths" of those who would represent the system of slavery as sanctioned by the religion of Christ.

I know that you do not lack the power to restore me to liberty. This you can do by an act as simple as that by which a father gives liberty to a son. Until you do this, I shall hold you as a kidnapper of my person, and a robber of my hard earnings.

But I forbear. No; I will not close this letter without adding a word respecting my beloved brothers and sisters who are yet in chains. If you have any regard for justice, any love for humanity, any concern for reputation, any care for your own salvation, I beseech you to cease this moment to hold my brothers and sisters in slavery. Set them free, and thus prove to an offending world that you are worthy to be a disciple of the meek and lowly Jesus.

I am, sir, your fellow man, but not your slave.
