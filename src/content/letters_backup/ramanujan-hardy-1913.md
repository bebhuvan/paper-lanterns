Dear Sir,

I beg to introduce myself to you as a clerk in the Accounts Department of the Port Trust Office at Madras on a salary of only £20 per annum. I am now about 23 years of age. I have had no University education but I have undergone the ordinary school course. After leaving school I have been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at Mathematics.

I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed in a University course, but I am striking out a new path for myself. I have made a special investigation of divergent series in general and the results I get are termed by the local mathematicians as "startling."

Very recently I came across a tract published by you styled "Orders of Infinity" in page 36 of which I find a statement that no definite expression has been as yet found for the number of prime numbers less than any given number. I have found an expression which very nearly approximates to the real result, the error being negligible. I would request you to go through the enclosed papers. Being poor, if you are convinced that there is anything of value I would like to have my theorems published.

I have not given the actual investigations nor the expressions that I get but I have indicated the lines on which I proceed. Being inexperienced I would very highly value any advice you give me. Requesting you to excuse me for the trouble I give you.

I remain, Dear Sir, Yours truly, S. Ramanujan

P.S. - I am sending you with this letter some of my mathematical results which I have arrived at. I hope you will find time to go through them:

**On the sum of the series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... to infinity:**

I have found that this infinite series, which appears to diverge to infinity, actually equals -1/12. This may seem impossible, but I can demonstrate through analytical continuation that:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... = -1/12

**On partition functions:**

I have discovered remarkable patterns in the way integers can be partitioned. For example, if p(n) represents the number of ways to partition n, then:

p(5n+4) ≡ 0 (mod 5)
p(7n+5) ≡ 0 (mod 7)  
p(11n+6) ≡ 0 (mod 11)

These congruences reveal hidden arithmetic structure in what appears random.

**On infinite series for π:**

I have found several rapidly converging series for 1/π, including:

1/π = (√8/9801) Σ [(4k)!(1103+26390k)]/[((k!)^4)(396^(4k))]

This converges so rapidly that each term provides approximately 8 correct decimal places.

**On highly composite numbers:**

I have identified a special class of numbers which have more divisors than any smaller positive integer. These "highly composite numbers" follow patterns that illuminate the distribution of divisibility properties.

**On mock theta functions:**

In my recent work, I have discovered functions that behave like theta functions in some ways but not others. These "mock theta functions" seem to bridge modular forms and ordinary generating functions in unexpected ways.

**On the tau function:**

Connected to the modular discriminant Δ(τ) = τ ∏(1-τ^n)^24, I have found a multiplicative function τ(n) with remarkable properties, including:

τ(mn) = τ(m)τ(n) when gcd(m,n) = 1
|τ(p)| ≤ 2p^(11/2) for prime p

**On continued fractions:**

I have developed novel continued fraction representations for many important constants and functions. For instance, I can express certain algebraic numbers through continued fractions with patterns that reveal their deeper arithmetic nature.

**On infinite nested radicals:**

I have found exact values for expressions like:

√(1 + 2√(1 + 3√(1 + 4√(1 + ...))))

These nested radicals, which might seem to have no definite value, actually equal precise rational or algebraic numbers.

**On the Riemann zeta function:**

I have discovered transformations and series representations for ζ(s) that provide new computational methods and reveal connections to theta functions and elliptic integrals.

**On elliptic integrals and modular equations:**

I have found algebraic relations between elliptic integrals evaluated at different moduli. These "modular equations" of various degrees provide transformation formulas that simplify complex calculations.

I realize these results may seem impossible or incorrect, especially given my lack of formal mathematical training. However, I have verified them through numerous calculations and different approaches. Each formula has emerged through what I can only describe as mathematical intuition - patterns that reveal themselves when I contemplate the relationships between numbers.

My mathematical knowledge comes primarily from a single book - Carr's "Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics" - which I have studied intensively. Beyond that, my results arise from what seems like direct insight into mathematical truth. Sometimes the formulas come to me in dreams, fully formed, and I spend days verifying their correctness.

I am particularly interested in your opinion on the convergent series for π and the partition function congruences, as these seem to have practical applications for computation while revealing deep theoretical structure.

I understand that without rigorous proofs, these results may appear to be mere numerical curiosities. However, I believe they point toward fundamental truths about the nature of numbers and infinite processes that deserve serious mathematical investigation.

If any of these theorems interest you, I would be deeply grateful for your guidance on how to develop them further and present them to the mathematical community. I sense that I have only glimpsed the surface of a vast mathematical landscape that remains to be explored.

Your humble correspondent in the pursuit of mathematical truth,
S. Ramanujan
