Nothing compared to what I feel for you. All the angers, the pains, the infidelities, the betrayals are nothing compared to what I feel for you.

You know that all my eyes see, all I touch with myself, from any distance, is Diego. The caress of fabrics, the color of colors, the wires, the nerves, the pencils, the leaves, the dust, the cells, the war and the sun, everything experienced in the minutes of the non-clocks and the non-calendars and the non-empty glances, is you.

I would like to give you everything that you have never had, and even so you would not know the marvelous thing it is to be able to live this love which I feel for you.

You have been my Mexico, my universe. I have built my dreams around you. Every fiber of my being yearns for you, Diego. My blood calls to yours across any distance.

The pain I carry in my body is nothing — nothing! — compared to the pain I feel when you are not here. My spine may be broken, my body may betray me, but my love for you grows stronger with each breath I take.

Paint with me, Diego. Live with me. Let us create something beautiful together, even if the world burns around us.
