My dear Krishnan,

I write to you with trembling hands and a heart full of wonder at what we have just witnessed in our laboratory! The experiments we conducted this morning have revealed something so extraordinary that I can barely contain my excitement. Light, when it passes through a transparent medium, emerges not only diminished in intensity but actually changed in character - this is the new radiation I have discovered, and I believe it will revolutionize our understanding of matter and light interaction.

For weeks now, we have been puzzling over the peculiar observations in our scattering experiments. You will remember how we noticed that when we examined the light scattered by various transparent substances - benzene, toluene, hexane - there seemed to be additional spectral lines that could not be explained by the existing theories of Rayleigh scattering.

Today's measurements have confirmed beyond doubt that these are not experimental artifacts or impurities, but represent a fundamental new phenomenon. When monochromatic light encounters molecules, a small fraction undergoes what I can only describe as inelastic collision - the photons lose or gain energy in discrete quanta, emerging with frequencies different from the incident radiation.

The implications are staggering! We have found direct evidence of energy exchanges between light and molecular vibrations. The frequency shifts we observe correspond exactly to the vibrational frequencies of the molecules themselves. This means we now have a powerful new tool for investigating molecular structure and dynamics.

Let me describe what we observed more precisely. When we illuminated our samples with the intense blue-green line from a mercury vapor lamp and examined the scattered light through our spectrograph, we found not only the original frequency (which classical theory predicts) but also new lines shifted to both longer and shorter wavelengths.

The lines shifted to longer wavelengths - what we might call "Stokes lines" - are much stronger than those shifted to shorter wavelengths - the "anti-Stokes lines." This asymmetry immediately suggests a connection to the statistical distribution of molecular energy states, precisely as quantum mechanics would predict.

Most remarkably, the magnitude of these frequency shifts is characteristic of each molecular species. Benzene shows shifts different from those of toluene, which differ again from carbon tetrachloride. We have discovered what amounts to a molecular fingerprint in light scattering - each compound produces its own unique pattern of frequency shifts.

The theoretical implications are equally profound. This phenomenon provides direct experimental verification of the quantum mechanical picture of molecular energy levels. The discrete nature of the frequency shifts confirms that molecular vibrations are indeed quantized, as the new quantum theory proposes.

But beyond confirming existing theory, our discovery opens entirely new avenues of investigation. We now have a method for studying molecular vibrations that is far more sensitive and informative than anything previously available. By analyzing the pattern of scattered frequencies, we should be able to determine molecular structures, identify chemical compounds, and investigate chemical reactions at the molecular level.

I am particularly excited about the prospects for studying complex biological molecules. If we can develop this technique further, it might provide insights into the structure and behavior of proteins, nucleic acids, and other substances crucial to life processes. The medical and biological applications alone could be revolutionary.

The discovery also has immediate practical implications for analytical chemistry. The characteristic nature of the scattering patterns means we have found a new method for chemical identification and analysis. This could prove valuable in fields ranging from pharmaceutical research to environmental monitoring.

I must confess that when we first noticed these anomalous lines several weeks ago, I suspected we were dealing with fluorescence or some form of impurity. Your suggestion that we examine extremely pure samples was crucial in establishing that this is indeed a fundamental scattering phenomenon, not a secondary effect.

The intensity measurements we made today are particularly revealing. The strength of the new radiation is proportional to the fourth power of the frequency, just as Rayleigh scattering is, but with the crucial difference that the scattered photons carry information about molecular vibrations. This relationship suggests deep connections between classical scattering theory and quantum mechanics.

I am already planning our next series of experiments. We must systematically investigate different types of molecules - gases, liquids, and solids - to understand the full scope of this phenomenon. We should examine how temperature affects the intensity ratio between Stokes and anti-Stokes lines. We must also investigate whether rotating molecules produce similar effects.

The international scientific community must be informed of this discovery immediately. I plan to submit preliminary results to Nature within the week, followed by more detailed papers to the Indian Journal of Physics. This discovery places Indian science on the world map in a way that will inspire young researchers throughout our country.

But I am also acutely aware of the need for careful, systematic investigation before we make grand claims. We must ensure that our results are reproducible, that we understand the conditions necessary for observing the effect, and that we can provide a complete theoretical explanation.

The theoretical framework is already becoming clear to me. This scattering represents inelastic collisions between photons and molecules, where energy is exchanged in discrete quanta corresponding to molecular vibrational or rotational states. The quantum mechanical treatment of this process should predict exactly the frequency shifts and intensity relationships we observe.

What strikes me most profoundly is how this discovery demonstrates the unity of different branches of physics. Our work connects optics, molecular physics, quantum mechanics, and statistical thermodynamics in a beautiful, coherent picture. The frequency shifts reveal molecular energy levels, the intensity patterns reflect thermal populations, and the scattering process itself exemplifies quantum mechanical interactions.

I cannot help but reflect on how this discovery emerged from our systematic investigation of fundamental questions about light and matter. We were not seeking practical applications or trying to solve specific technical problems, but simply trying to understand nature more deeply. Yet our discovery promises to have enormous practical value alongside its theoretical significance.

This reinforces my conviction that basic research is the foundation of all scientific progress. By pursuing questions that intrigue us, by investigating phenomena that seem puzzling or anomalous, we often stumble upon discoveries far more valuable than anything we could have planned.

The excitement I feel today reminds me why I chose to become a scientist. There is no greater thrill than the moment when nature reveals one of her secrets, when careful observation and systematic investigation suddenly illuminate previously hidden aspects of reality. Today we have added a new chapter to the great book of scientific knowledge.

I believe this discovery will establish India as a significant contributor to world science and inspire a generation of young Indians to pursue careers in research. We have shown that groundbreaking discoveries can emerge from laboratories anywhere in the world, given dedication, careful technique, and willingness to investigate the unexpected.

My dear colleague, I wanted to share this moment of discovery with you immediately, not only because of your crucial contributions to the work, but because I know you will appreciate the beauty and significance of what we have found. Tomorrow we begin the detailed investigations that will fully establish this new branch of optical science.

Your excited colleague in this magnificent adventure of discovery,

C.V. Raman

P.S. - I suggest we immediately begin preparing samples of different molecular types for systematic investigation. The crystalline substances might show particularly interesting effects due to their ordered molecular arrangements. We may have opened a window into the molecular world that will keep us busy for years to come!
