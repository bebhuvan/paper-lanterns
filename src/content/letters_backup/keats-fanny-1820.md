You have absorb'd me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I was dissolving—I should be exquisitely miserable without the hope of soon seeing you. I should be afraid to separate myself far from you.

My sweet Girl, I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest. You have ravish'd me away by a Power I cannot resist; and yet I could resist till I saw you; and even since I have seen you I have endeavoured often 'to reason against the reasons of my Love.'

I can bear to be away from you no longer. Every hour I am more and more concentrated in you; every thing else tastes like chaff in my mouth. I feel it almost impossible to go to—I will imagine you Venus tonight and pray, pray, pray to your star like a Heathen.

Your's ever, fair Star, John Keats.

I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion—I have shudder'd at it. I shudder no more—I could be martyr'd for my Religion—Love is my religion—I could die for that. I could die for you. My Creed is Love and you are its only tenet.

You have been my Priest—it seems I see you everywhere. In the song of the bird, in the whisper of the wind, in my dreams, you are always there. When I am not with you, I am not living; I am merely existing in the pale shadow of life.

The very first week I knew you I wrote myself your vassal; but burnt the Letter as the very next time I saw you I thought you manifested some dislike to me. If you should ever feel for Man at the first sight what I did for you, I am lost.
