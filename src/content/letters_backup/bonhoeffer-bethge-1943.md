The ultimate question for a responsible man to ask is not how he is to extricate himself heroically from the affair, but how the coming generation is to live. It is only from this question, with its responsibility toward history, that fruitful solutions can come.

My dear Eberhard, as I write this letter in my cell, the bombs are falling on Berlin again tonight, and I find myself thinking not about my own fate—which seems increasingly sealed—but about the world that will emerge from the ashes of this terrible war.

You asked in your last letter whether I regret the choices that have brought me here, whether I wish I had remained safely in America when the opportunity was given to me. How can I explain to you, my friend, that the only regret I have is not acting sooner, not speaking more clearly against the evil that has consumed our nation?

When I see what the Nazi regime has done—the systematic murder of the Jews, the corruption of the Church, the transformation of Germany into a machine of death—I know that silence would have been complicity. There comes a point when the Christian conscience cannot remain passive in the face of such overwhelming evil.

But this raises the most difficult theological questions, doesn't it? How does a man of God justify participation in a plot to kill another human being, even one as monstrous as Hitler? How does a pastor reconcile the commandment "Thou shalt not kill" with the moral imperative to stop a tyrant who is murdering millions?

I have wrestled with this question through many sleepless nights in this cell, and I have come to understand that sometimes we must take upon ourselves the burden of guilt in order to prevent greater evil. This is what I call the "responsible action"—the willingness to become guilty before God in order to serve God's greater purpose for humanity.

The Sermon on the Mount still stands, Eberhard. The teachings of Jesus about love and forgiveness remain eternally true. But they must be applied in a world where evil men use our Christian forbearance as a weapon against the innocent. Sometimes love itself demands that we stop the hand raised against our neighbor, even at the cost of our own moral purity.

This is not cheap grace, my friend. This is the costly grace that demands everything from us—our comfort, our safety, our moral certitude, even our lives. When Jesus called his disciples, he bid them come and die. I am finally beginning to understand what that means.

But enough about my own situation. What concerns me more is the question of what kind of Christianity will emerge from this catastrophe. The old Christendom is dying—indeed, it began dying long before Hitler came to power. The cozy accommodation between the Church and worldly power, the assumption that being German and being Christian were somehow the same thing—all of this has been revealed as hollow.

What we need now is what I have come to call "religionless Christianity"—a faith that doesn't depend on the props of institutional power or cultural privilege, a Christianity that can speak to modern people in their real situation without requiring them to first become "religious" in some artificial sense.

The God who lets us live in the world without the working hypothesis of God is the God before whom we stand continually. Before God and with God we live without God. This sounds paradoxical, but I believe it points toward the future of Christian faith in a secular age.

We have been witnesses to the collapse of all the old certainties—political, social, religious. The question is whether the Church can rediscover the radical message of the Gospel beneath all the cultural accretions that have obscured it. Can we learn to speak of God in a world that has supposedly "come of age," that no longer needs God to explain the natural world or provide psychological comfort?

I believe we can, but only if we are willing to follow Jesus in his powerlessness rather than seeking the easy victory of worldly success. The God who suffers with humanity in its pain, the God who is weak and powerless in the world—this is the God who can speak to modern people because this God shares their real situation.

Sometimes I think that my imprisonment has been a gift, stripping away all the external supports of faith and forcing me to discover what remains when everything else is taken away. What remains is the simple human reality of Christ—his complete solidarity with suffering humanity, his refusal to escape from the world's pain.

This is what the coming generation needs to hear—not that faith will solve all their problems or make their lives easier, but that God is present with them in their struggles, that the crucified Christ walks alongside them in their own suffering and doubt.

Pray for me, dear friend, not that I might be delivered from this situation, but that I might be faithful to what God is calling me to be and do, even unto death. And pray that the seeds we have planted through our witness will somehow bear fruit in a world that seems determined to tear itself apart.

The darkness is deep, but I still believe that the light of Christ will ultimately prevail. Not through triumphant victory, but through the mysterious power of sacrificial love.
