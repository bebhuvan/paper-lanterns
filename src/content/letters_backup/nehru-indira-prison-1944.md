Life is like a game of cards. The hand you are dealt represents determinism; the way you play it is free will.

My darling Indu, from the quiet of my prison cell, I think often of you and the world you will inherit. These walls cannot contain my thoughts or my hopes for you and for our beloved India.

I have been reading about the great movements of history, and I am struck by how often the tide of human affairs turns on the courage and conviction of individuals who refuse to accept injustice. You, my dear daughter, are growing up in such times.

Remember always that freedom is not merely the absence of restraint, but the presence of opportunity. When India becomes free—and it will—the real work will begin. The work of building a nation that serves not the few, but the many; not just those who are like us, but all who call this land home.

I want you to understand that our struggle is not against the British people, but against a system that denies human dignity. We must fight hatred with love, ignorance with education, and despair with hope.

The books I am reading here speak of many civilizations that have risen and fallen. What made some endure while others crumbled was not their military might, but their ability to adapt, to include rather than exclude, to learn rather than merely conquer.

This is the India I dream of for you—not one that merely wins its independence, but one that wins its place among the great nations of the world by the nobility of its ideals and the generosity of its spirit.
