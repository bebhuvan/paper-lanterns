about:
  context: "This was Martí's final letter, written on the day before his death in battle during the Cuban War of Independence. Discovered unfinished in his coat pocket, it reveals his deep concern not only about Spanish colonialism but also about potential American imperialism in Latin America. This letter encapsulates his vision of a united Latin America free from all foreign domination."
  significance: "This letter is considered one of the most important documents in Latin American political thought. It articulates the fear that Cuban independence might simply exchange one imperial master for another. Martí's concerns about U.S. expansion proved prophetic, as the Spanish-American War would lead to American influence over Cuba and other former Spanish territories. His vision of 'Our America' influenced generations of Latin American intellectuals and independence movements."
  author_bio: "José Julián Martí Pérez (1853-1895) was a Cuban poet, essayist, journalist, translator, professor, and publisher who is considered a Cuban national hero and an important figure in Latin American literature. His political activism for Cuban independence served as an inspiration for the Cuban revolutionary movement led by Fidel Castro."
  recipient_info: "Manuel Mercado was Martí's longtime friend and confidant, a Mexican intellectual who shared his vision of Latin American unity. Mercado later played a crucial role in preserving and publishing Martí's writings, ensuring that his political and literary legacy would endure."

My dearest friend Manuel,

I am daily in danger of giving my life for my country and for my duty—since I understand it and have spirits to fulfill it—to prevent, by the independence of Cuba, the United States from spreading over the West Indies and falling with added weight upon other lands of Our America.

Everything I have done up to now, and everything I will do, is directed toward this end. I have had to work in silence and somewhat indirectly, because there are things that must be achieved by concealment in order to be accomplished at all.

The same lesser and public duties—the same apparent duties—that I have imposed upon myself here, prevented me and will continue to prevent me until the last moment from writing to you as frequently and extensively as I would like, or as you deserve. I have never felt more certain of the correctness of my resolve, nor have I ever seen more clearly the consistency between my emotional duty and my reasoned duty.

I have lived inside the monster and I know its entrails; and my sling is David's. The North Americans' contempt for us is only equaled by their ignorance of us, but out of what blind arrogance! They believe in necessity, in the right that derives from superiority—in "manifest destiny"—they believe that the Spanish-American peoples are a collection of contemptible tribes.

But I have seen how they live. I have seen the sordidness, the servility, the materialism that accompanies their progress. I have seen how a people can lose its soul in the pursuit of wealth, how democracy can become the tyranny of the mob, how freedom can become license.

Our America cannot be like that. We must build something new, something that honors both our indigenous roots and our Spanish heritage, something that embraces progress without losing dignity, something that values the human spirit above material gain.

The revolution that we make is not just for Cuba, but for all of Our America. It is a revolution of ideas as much as guns, a revolution of the spirit as much as the sword. We fight not just against Spain, but against the whole system that would make us perpetual colonies, whether Spanish or American.

If I fall tomorrow, know that I died believing in the possibility of a free and united America—from the Río Grande to Patagonia—where all peoples can live in dignity and brotherhood.

Your José Martí
