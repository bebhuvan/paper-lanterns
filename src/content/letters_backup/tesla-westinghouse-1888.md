The future belongs to alternating current, Mr. Westinghouse. What we are building together will light the world and power the dreams of generations yet to come.

I have seen the vision clearly — cities illuminated by the gentle glow of electric light, factories humming with the power of AC motors, homes where the flip of a switch banishes darkness forever. This is not mere fantasy; it is the inevitable result of the principles we are now putting into practice.

Edison's direct current system, for all its early success, is fundamentally limited. It cannot travel far without massive loss of power. It requires power stations every few miles. But our alternating current system — ah, this can travel hundreds of miles with minimal loss!

I must confess, there are moments when I feel like Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods to give to humanity. The forces we are harnessing are so powerful, so transformative, that sometimes I wonder if we truly understand what we are unleashing.

Last night, I stood in my laboratory and watched the electric arcs dance between my hands — pure energy, controlled and directed by human will. In that moment, I felt the future rushing toward us like a great wave of light.

We are not merely inventors, Mr. Westinghouse. We are architects of tomorrow. Every patent we file, every motor we perfect, every mile of wire we string brings us closer to a world our grandfathers could never have imagined.
