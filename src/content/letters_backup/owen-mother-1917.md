My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity. Yet these elegies are to this generation in no sense consolatory. They may be to the next. All a poet can do today is warn.

My dearest Mother, I write to you from this hospital where they treat what the doctors call "neurasthenia" and what we soldiers simply call "the horrors." The nightmares have become less frequent now, though I still wake sometimes to the sound of shells that exist only in my shattered nerves.

I know you worry about my state of mind, about the darkness that has crept into my letters and my poetry. You ask why I cannot write of beautiful things, of hope, of the glory that the newspapers tell us we are fighting for. But Mother, I cannot unsee what I have seen, cannot unknow what I know about this war that devours our generation.

Yesterday in the trenches seems like another lifetime, yet it lives in me with terrible clarity. The rat-infested dugouts where we crouched for days, listening to the whistle of approaching shells, knowing that each one might be our last. The poison gas that turns strong men into drowning victims, their lungs filling with fluid as they die in agony. The machine guns that cut down waves of advancing soldiers like wheat before the scythe.

I have watched boys—for they were boys, Mother, seventeen and eighteen years old—march into battle singing hymns, believing they were dying for God and country. I have seen those same boys stumbling back from No Man's Land, if they came back at all, with their faces blown away, their minds shattered, their faith in humanity destroyed.

The papers at home speak of glorious charges and heroic sacrifices. They use words like "honor" and "duty" and "the ultimate sacrifice." But they do not speak of Private Jenkins, nineteen years old, calling for his mother as he bled out in the mud. They do not mention how we had to leave him there for three days because the sniper fire made rescue impossible, how we listened to his cries growing weaker until blessed silence came.

This is why I write, Mother. Not for glory or recognition, but because someone must tell the truth about what we have done to each other in the name of civilization. Someone must speak for the dead who can no longer speak for themselves. Someone must warn the living that war is not a game or an adventure but a machine that grinds up human souls and spits out grief.

I met a fellow poet here, Siegfried Sassoon, who understands this burden. He too has seen the elephant, as the Americans say, and like me, he cannot remain silent about what we have witnessed. We encourage each other's work, though we know our words will not be welcome in a world that needs its heroic myths to make sense of this senseless slaughter.

My poem "Dulce et Decorum Est" has caused quite a stir among the staff here. They think it too graphic, too brutal in its imagery. But how else does one describe watching a man die from poison gas? How does one make pretty the sight of young men hanging on the barbed wire like broken scarecrows?

*If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood  
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,  
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud  
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—  
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest  
To children ardent for some desperate glory,  
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est  
Pro patria mori.*

"It is sweet and right to die for one's country"—what a monstrous lie that has proven to be, Mother. There is nothing sweet about death in these trenches, nothing right about this industrial-scale murder we call war.

Yet I do not despair entirely. If my poems can reach even a few readers, if they can plant seeds of doubt about the glory of war in young minds that might otherwise march eagerly to slaughter, then perhaps some small good can come from this horror. Perhaps the next generation will read our words and say, "Never again."

I know I may not survive this war—so many of my friends have not. But if I die, I want you to know that I died trying to serve truth rather than propaganda, humanity rather than nationalism. The greatest honor I can imagine is not a medal for bravery but the knowledge that my words might prevent even one unnecessary death.

The doctors say I will be well enough to return to the front soon. I do not want to go back, Mother. Every instinct screams at me to run, to hide, to preserve what remains of my sanity. But my men are there, the boys I led into battle, and I cannot abandon them. If I must die, let me die with them rather than safe in England while others take my place in hell.

Keep my poems safe, Mother. If something happens to me, see that they are published. Let the world know what we really did here, what price we really paid for the politicians' grand ambitions. Let my voice join the chorus of the dead, warning the living about the true cost of war.

Pray for peace, Mother. Pray that this ends soon, before we lose an entire generation to the mud of Flanders.
