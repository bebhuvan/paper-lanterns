# Paper Lanterns - Project Handoff Documentation

## Project Overview
"Paper Lanterns" is an Astro-based static site showcasing historical letters and speeches across cultures and time periods. The site features a clean, minimal design with dark mode support, search functionality, and curated collections of correspondence from notable historical figures.

## Current Status
The project has been **significantly expanded** with a fully functional website now containing **61 historical letters + 5 speeches**. Recent major expansion added 16+ profound letters from voices like Thoreau, Leonardo da Vinci, Newton, Dostoevsky, Darwin, Walt Whitman, Helen Keller, Marcus Aurelius, and more. The collection now spans ancient philosophy to modern science, revolutionary thought to spiritual awakening.

**Ready for continued expansion** with more transformative letters from missing voices and cultures.

- **Framework**: Astro v5.12.9 (Static Site Generation)

## Content Structure

Each letter/speech follows this markdown frontmatter structure:
```yaml
---
title: "Letter title or excerpt"
author:
  name: "Author Name"
  birth_year: YYYY
  death_year: YYYY
  bio: "Brief author biography"
recipient: "Recipient name"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
context: "Letter context"
location: "Location written"
excerpt: "Key quote or excerpt"
signature: "Letter signature"
source: "Source attribution"
collections: ["category1", "category2"]
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
featured: true/false
drop_cap_color: "#hexcolor"
about:
  context: "Historical context paragraph"
  significance: "Why this letter matters"
  author_bio: "Extended author biography"
  recipient_info: "About the recipient"
  links:
    - title: "Link title"
      url: "https://example.com"
      description: "Link description"
---

```

## Issues Resolved

### Recent Fixes
1. **Search visibility in dark mode** - Added proper color CSS properties
2. **404 errors on archive links** - Fixed collection name mapping (letters→letter, speeches→speech)
3. **Dark mode flickering** - Moved theme initialization script to prevent flash
4. **Search not showing results** - Converted from server-side to client-side search
5. **Random button 404s** - Fixed API to return correct singular route names
6. **Duplicate navigation buttons** - Cleaned up component structure

### Known Minor Issues
- Temporary file creation warnings in dev server (cosmetic only)
- Some 404s in logs for old letter URLs (legacy, doesn't affect functionality)

### Critical Content Structure Constraint
**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The project architecture only supports TWO content collections:
- `src/content/letters/` (routes to `/letter/[slug]`)
- `src/content/speeches/` (routes to `/speech/[slug]`)

**DO NOT create additional content folders** (like `poems/`, `documents/`, etc.) as this will:
- Cause 400 errors in the development server
- Break the routing system (no corresponding page templates)
- Break search functionality (hardcoded for letters/speeches only)
- Break the random content API (only configured for these two collections)

**Error Example**: Creating `src/content/poems/file.md` causes:
```
Auto-generating collections for folders in "src/content/" that are not defined as collections.
This is deprecated, so you should define these collections yourself in "src/content.config.ts".
The following collections have been auto-generated: poems
```
This leads to routing failures and 400 errors.

**Solution**: All content must go in either:
- `letters/` folder → accessible via `/letter/slug` 
- `speeches/` folder → accessible via `/speech/slug`

If you want to add other content types (poems, documents, etc.), add them as letters with appropriate metadata indicating their true nature in the `collections` and `tags` fields.

**Template for new letters:**
- Follow the existing frontmatter structure exactly
- Include comprehensive "about" section with context, significance, bios, and links
- Choose appropriate `drop_cap_color` and `featured` status
- Add to relevant `collections` and `tags`
- Place in `/src/content/letters/` directory

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Deployment Notes
- Static site ready for any hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
- No server-side dependencies
- All search functionality works client-side
- Build output in `dist/` directory

## Content Guidelines

### Adding New Letters
1. Research thoroughly - include accurate dates, context, historical significance
2. Write compelling excerpts that capture the letter's essence
3. Provide comprehensive "about" sections with multiple perspectives
4. Include relevant external links to educational resources
5. Use appropriate collections and tags for discoverability
6. Choose featured status thoughtfully (currently 8-10 featured items)

### Quality Standards
- Historical accuracy is paramount
- All letters should be in public domain or fair use
- Educational value and human interest should guide selection
- Diverse voices across cultures, time periods, and domains
- Complete metadata required for all entries

## Handoff Instructions

### For the Next Developer/Claude Instance:
1. **Primary Task**: Complete the modern visionary letters collection (MLK, Einstein, Carson, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca)
2. **Follow the established pattern**: Use existing letters as templates
3. **Maintain quality**: Each letter needs full metadata, historical context, and educational links
4. **Test functionality**: Ensure new letters appear in search, archive, and random features
5. **Optional enhancements**: Add more letters from other domains if time permits

### Code Quality
- The codebase follows Astro best practices
- CSS uses modern custom properties for maintainable theming
- JavaScript is minimal and vanilla (no heavy frameworks)
- Content structure is consistent and well-documented
- Search functionality is optimized for performance

## Success Metrics
- ✅ 30+ diverse historical letters implemented
- ✅ Full-featured search and navigation
- ✅ Responsive design with dark mode
- ✅ Rich metadata and educational context
- ✅ Cross-cultural representation (Indian, European, American, Middle Eastern, etc.)
- ✅ Multiple time periods (Ancient to Modern)
- ⏳ Modern visionary collection completion (80% done)

The project represents a high-quality digital humanities resource that celebrates the power of written correspondence throughout history while providing modern web functionality and accessibility.
